# Working agreements for this repository

Standing instructions for Claude sessions on this repo. Structural reference
lives in `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`; module business rules live in
`CLAUDE_SESSION_CONTEXT.md`; the Figma design system (tokens, component
mapping to AntD, naming conventions) lives in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — read
it before building or styling any screen. Both are living templates: fill in
gaps found while building, in the same change that finds them.

**Standing rule, stated explicitly by the user — anything they teach a
session (a correction, a technique, a "no, do it like X instead", a gotcha
hit while building) gets written into the relevant `.md` file in the same
change, not just held in that session's own memory.** `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`
and `FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md` are where Figma-specific lessons go (new
numbered subsection or a row edit, per their own "living template" rules
above); this file is where a lesson about the *working process itself*
goes (which MCP server to prefer, which branch to push to, and so on). The
point is that the next session starts smarter than this one did, not that
it re-learns the same thing from scratch.

Direction matters for which doc to read: building a screen *from* Figma
reads `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`. Pushing this app's UI *into* Figma ("vibe
code to Figma") reads `FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md` instead — it's the user's
index of which Figma component a given piece of this app's UI should be
built from, so a real library component gets reused instead of a fresh
lookalike shape getting drawn.

The `figma-fidelity` skill (`.claude/skills/figma-fidelity/SKILL.md`) packages
`FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3.4's drawer/form pattern as an enforced checklist —
invoke it (or follow it directly) before building, editing, or auditing any
screen/drawer/component against Figma, and whenever a ticket cites another
ticket as "same fields/logic as X." It exists because "apply this pattern
elsewhere" was once under-scoped to a surface-level spacing fix while the
target's own ticket required a full structural match to a sibling
implementation — don't repeat that.

The `code-to-figma` skill (`.claude/skills/code-to-figma/SKILL.md`) is the
user's standard for pushing code / a built screen / HTML into Figma. It
covers every state and flow, titled rows with notes and arrows, real
components and data, and ticket edits re-checked first. Invoke it for any
"put this in Figma" request, and update it whenever the user corrects how
such a push should look.

For the "👩🏻‍🚀 Personal Dashboard - HR Module" file (`1FCRdGhHru6czP5P6h06kH`),
use the **Figma Desktop Bridge plugin** (`mcp__Figma_Southleft__*` —
`figma_execute`/`figma_capture_screenshot`/`figma_pair_plugin`) for writes and
verification, not the official Figma MCP's `use_figma`/`get_screenshot`. See
`FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §4.2 for why: the official MCP's screenshot tool
looked stale/wrong in this file even when the document was already correct,
while the Desktop Bridge's `figma_capture_screenshot` (renders the user's own
live document) matched immediately and consistently. If `figma_diagnose`
reports the bridge disconnected, re-pair with `figma_pair_plugin` (6-character
code, 5-minute expiry, entered into the plugin's Cloud Mode toggle) rather
than falling back to the official MCP.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` must stay current. Every change that ships gets an entry **in the
same commit that makes the change** — not batched up afterwards.

- Cite the Jira ticket key when a change comes from a ticket.
- When a change comes from review feedback or a judgment call, say so, and
  record the reasoning. The point is that the *why* survives, not just the *what*.
- Keep the "Open items" table honest: unresolved PM questions, known
  off-spec areas, and tickets that could not be built go there so they are not
  rediscovered from scratch next session.

## Git

- Push to the repository's **default branch**, which is
  `claude/magical-hamilton-RrDQJ`. There is no `main` or `master` branch here,
  and `origin/HEAD` is not set locally, so `git ls-remote --heads origin` is the
  way to confirm the branch list if this name ever changes.
- Also keep the session's working branch in sync so tooling does not report
  unpushed commits.

## Verification

There is no test suite and no lint config, and `tsconfig.json` disables
`noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters`. So:

1. `npx tsc --noEmit` must be clean.
2. Verify UI changes live in a browser before calling them done — start a dev
   server on a scratch port, drive the interaction with a throwaway Playwright
   script (`chromium.launch({ executablePath: '/opt/pw-browsers/chromium' })`),
   read the screenshots, then delete the script and kill the server.
3. Sweep for dead imports by hand after deleting code; the type-checker will not
   catch them.

## Roster module

Three calendar variants exist side by side. As of the 11 Aug 2026 rewrite of
MOVE-3608, **Roster 4.0 (`Roster4Page.tsx`) is the one that matches the PRD** —
a Monday–Sunday month grid with grouped bars. `RosterPage.tsx` and
`Roster3Page.tsx` implement the older matrix reading (employees as rows, dates
as columns) and are kept only as prior explorations.

All roster business rules live in `rosterStatusLogic.tsx` and are shared by every
variant, so a rule fix lands everywhere at once. Keep it that way — presentation
belongs in the pages.

## Jira watch (nightly routine)

A scheduled Routine wakes a fresh session every night at 23:00 SGT, checks
whether any ticket under the Leave epic **MOVE-3410** has been edited since the
last applied change, and applies what it finds. It is **read-only against
Jira** — it never edits, comments on, or transitions a ticket.

- `tools/jira-desc-diff.py` is what makes this tractable. Most Leave ticket
  edits are Jira reflowing its own table markup; the script normalises both
  sides of a description edit to table *cells* so a formatting-only edit prints
  nothing. Feed it the JSON that a `getJiraIssue` call with `expand: changelog`
  writes to disk, plus the date to diff from.
- **The watermark lives in the repo, not in the Routine.** The latest `on:`
  date in `src/components/leave/WhatsNew.tsx` is the last ticket edit that has
  been applied; that is what a run diffs from. So a missed night self-corrects
  on the next run rather than leaving a hole.
- Every change the Routine applies gets a `LEAVE_CHANGES` entry and a `<Mark>`
  pinned to the control it affected, the same as a change made by hand. That
  registry is the module's own record of what moved and when.
