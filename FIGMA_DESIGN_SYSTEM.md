# Figma Design System Reference

This document exists so design decisions made in Figma travel into the code
(and back) instead of being re-guessed every time. It is a **living reference,
not a one-time note** — whoever owns the design system fills in the sections
below, and whoever writes code or Figma designs reads them first.

> **How this gets used:** before building a new screen or component, read the
> relevant sections here — tokens, the component mapping table, naming rules —
> and match them. When something here goes stale (a token renamed, a
> component's Figma variants changed), update this file in the same change
> that causes the drift, the same rule `CHANGELOG.md` follows.
>
> **This file is Figma → code.** Going the other way — pushing this app's UI
> *into* Figma — reads `FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md` instead, so an existing
> library component gets reused rather than a fresh one-off getting drawn.

Everything below is a **template**. Sections marked `<!-- fill in -->` are
empty on purpose — they get their real values from whoever maintains the
Figma file, not invented from the code side. Where a section already has
content, it was read directly from Figma or from a ticket and is safe to
build from; anything not filled in here should not be assumed or guessed —
ask, or read the live Figma file for that one thing.

## 1. Figma files

| File / Library | Link | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| "💎 ATOM - Business Component" | `https://www.figma.com/design/ZpEYnJ4POb86CDMAM3BWCG/%F0%9F%92%8E-ATOM---Business-Component` | The shared business-component library (e.g. `Tab/Tab Group`, `Side Navbar`, `FilterBar 3.0`, §3). **Always check this file first** when a screen needs a component that isn't a plain AntD primitive — it's the one confirmed shared library so far. |
| "👩🏻‍🚀 Leave - HR Module" | `https://www.figma.com/design/VYGulw8yaudo3FRAWh4sEh/%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8F%BB%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%9A%80-Leave---HR-Module-` | Real screens for the Leave epic (MOVE-3410) — a different file from the Business Component library above. The **data table** spec in §3.3 was read from here (its Leave listing table) and applies app-wide, not just to Leave. |
| "👩🏻‍🚀 Personal Dashboard - HR Module" | `https://www.figma.com/design/1FCRdGhHru6czP5P6h06kH/%F0%9F%91%A9%F0%9F%8F%BB%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%9A%80-Personal-Dashboard---HR-Module-` | Real screens for the Personal Dashboard epic (MOVE-3412) — a third file, distinct from both of the above. The **Drawers Template / form field-row** spec in §3.4 (the "Create Leave Type" component, nodes `39283:133569` / `39282:89715`) was read from here. |
| "🧭 COMPASS - Westpoint ATOM Design System 2.0" | `https://www.figma.com/design/gbSCJ7q9FcMZsZ6d5dbrRN/%F0%9F%A7%AD-COMPASS---Westpoint-ATOM-Design-System-2.0` | A fourth file — the base component-definition library itself (read via the **official** Figma MCP for a one-off lookup, not the Desktop Bridge, since nothing was being written there). Node `388:11438` ("Form" page) is the *source* page for `_Form / Form Item / Vertical` and its full `Type` variant set (§4.4/§4.5) — confirmed to be the same component already in use via the Personal Dashboard file, not a separate one. Checked here first when hunting for a `FilterBar`/`RangePicker`/`Segmented` component and found none of those three exist as ready components (§4.5) — don't re-search this file for them again, they were hand-built instead. |
<!-- fill in the rest -->
| e.g. "WLA Design System" | `https://figma.com/design/...` | Core tokens, base components |

**Which file is the source of truth for tokens vs. for screens?**
<!-- fill in — if they're different files, say which wins when they disagree -->

---

## 2. Design tokens

Fill in actual values (hex codes, px, font names) — not "primary blue", the
literal value, so it can be pasted into code without re-deriving it.

### 2.1 Color

| Token name (in Figma) | Value | Used for | AntD equivalent (if any) |
|---|---|---|---|
<!-- fill in, e.g. -->
| `color/primary/600` | `#____` | Primary buttons, links, active nav | `token.colorPrimary` |
| `color/success` | `#____` | Approved / success states | `token.colorSuccess` |
| `color/warning` | `#____` | Pending states | `token.colorWarning` |
| `color/danger` | `#____` | Rejected / destructive actions | `token.colorError` |
| `color/text/primary` | `#____` | Body text | `token.colorText` |
| `color/text/secondary` | `#____` | Secondary/muted text | `token.colorTextSecondary` |
| `color/border` | `#____` | Dividers, table borders | `token.colorBorder` |
| `color/bg/layout` | `#____` | Page background | — |

> Note: this codebase currently sets colors ad hoc via inline `style` (e.g.
> `#1a1a1a`, `#8c8c8c`, `#f5f5f5` scattered across files) rather than through
> AntD's `ConfigProvider` theme tokens. Once this section is filled in, the
> right follow-up is deciding whether to centralize these into a theme config
> — flag that as a separate task, don't fold it into an unrelated ticket.

### 2.2 Typography

| Token name | Font family | Size | Weight | Line height | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
<!-- fill in -->
| `heading/h2` | | | | | Page titles |
| `heading/h4` | | | | | Card/section titles |
| `body/regular` | | | | | Default body text |
| `body/small` | | | | | Table cells, secondary labels |

### 2.3 Spacing scale

<!-- fill in — e.g. 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 32, and which one is the
     default page gutter, card padding, gap between stacked sections, etc. -->

- Page gutter (left/right edge of content): `24px` (confirmed — see `padding:
  24` convention in every page component, e.g. `LeavePage.tsx`)
- Card internal padding: <!-- fill in -->
- Gap between stacked cards/sections: <!-- fill in -->
- Gap between inline items (buttons in a toolbar, tags in a row): <!-- fill in -->

### 2.4 Radius & shadow

<!-- fill in -->
- Card / drawer / modal corner radius:
- Button corner radius:
- Card shadow (if any):

### 2.5 Breakpoints

<!-- fill in, if the Figma file designs for more than one viewport width.
     This codebase is currently desktop-only (fixed 250px sidebar, no
     responsive breakpoints) — note here if that's intentional or a gap. -->

---

## 3. Component mapping (Figma → Ant Design)

The rule: **don't hand-roll a component AntD already provides** unless the
Figma design deviates from AntD's default in a way that matters. This table
is where "it deviates" gets written down, so the deviation is a decision, not
a drift.

| Figma component | AntD component used in code | Deviation from AntD default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
<!-- fill in as components come up, e.g. -->
| `Button/Primary` | `Button type="primary"` | none | |
| `Status Tag` | `Tag` | Custom color map per status (see `STATUS_TAG_COLOR` in `leave/LeaveApplicationDrawers.tsx`) | Figma's status colors should match this map — flag if they don't |
| `Table/Data Table` | `Table` | `size="small"`, no zebra striping | |
| `Drawer/Form` | `Drawer` + `Form` | Width fixed per drawer (`480`/`520`), not responsive | |
| `Empty State` | `Empty` | `image={Empty.PRESENTED_IMAGE_SIMPLE}` everywhere, never the default illustration | |
| `Tab/Tab Group` (ATOM Business Component, [node 424:16506](https://www.figma.com/design/ZpEYnJ4POb86CDMAM3BWCG/%F0%9F%92%8E-ATOM---Business-Component?node-id=424-16506)) | `common/PageTabs.tsx` (wraps `Anchor`, **not** `Tabs`) | The component's own Code Connect note maps it to AntD `Anchor` with `direction="horizontal"` — every tab item carries its own underline segment (colored active / faint default), not `Tabs`' shared baseline + ink bar. `PageTabs` adds one real deviation: items are stretched to equal width (Anchor sizes to content by default) to match the Figma spec. **Always use `PageTabs` for a page-level top tab bar** — this was called out explicitly as a standing rule, not a one-off. | Used in `employeeportal/EmployeePortalPage.tsx`'s Home/Leave/Claims/Pay Slip bar. Not yet retrofitted onto other pages' top-level tab bars (e.g. Claims' own "My Claims"/"Pending My Approval" sub-tabs still use plain `Tabs` — that's a nested in-panel toggle, arguably a different case, but worth a call if this component is meant to cover that shape too). |
| `Side Navbar` (ATOM Business Component, [node 425:16539](https://www.figma.com/design/ZpEYnJ4POb86CDMAM3BWCG/%F0%9F%92%8E-ATOM---Business-Component?node-id=425-16539)) | `layout/AppLayout.tsx`'s `Sider` | See `FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md` for the full token breakdown (item height/radius/margin, sub-item indent and tint) — kept there rather than duplicated here since that file is the one read before any further sidebar work. | An earlier pass joined an expanded section's sub-items into one seamless block; the real component keeps each sub-item independently, fully rounded, with the same small gap as every other row — just tinted and indented further. Fixed once actually read from Figma instead of a screenshot alone. |
| `FilterBar 3.0` (ATOM Business Component, [node 21:9490](https://www.figma.com/design/ZpEYnJ4POb86CDMAM3BWCG/%F0%9F%92%8E-ATOM---Business-Component?node-id=21-9490)) | No single AntD component — a composable toolbar row, see §3.2 | Not built from yet; recorded ahead of an explicit request ("bisa jadi saya akan minta kamu... di leave module") so the slot breakdown is ready when asked for. | The row already under `LeavePage.tsx`'s title (Last Updated On + Search Employees) is this component's shape, arrived at independently — see §3.2 for whether it matches slot-for-slot. |

### 3.2 Table toolbar (`FilterBar 3.0`) — a composable row, not a single component

Sits directly under a page's title (see §3.1) whenever that page's table has
its own filters/actions — **not on every page**, per the user: "tidak selalu
tergantung module nya apa" (not always, depends on the module). It is a bag
of optional slots, each an existing AntD primitive, laid out `display:flex,
gap:8px, alignItems:center`, every control **32px tall**:

| Slot (Figma prop) | AntD equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `noEmpty` — Date Selector | `<Text>{label}:</Text>` + `<DatePicker.RangePicker />` | Label right-aligned, colon at 2px/8px inline margins. Default example label "Last Updated"; `secondaryDatepicker` (version 2.0 only) adds a **second** one before the search box, own label (e.g. "Date Announcement") — two independent range filters, not one. |
| `search` — Table Query Searchbar | `<Input placeholder="Search for X.." />` | Fixed width **222px**. |
| `filterIcon10` / `filterIcon20` — Table Filter with Buttons | `<Button icon={<FilterOutlined />} />` | Icon-only, 32×32. Two Figma variants (`10`/`20`) render identically in this instance — likely alternate states/contexts, not a visual difference worth encoding until a second real case shows one. |
| `downloadButton` | `<Button icon={<VerticalAlignBottomOutlined />} />` | Icon-only. |
| `downloadButtonAlt` | `<Button icon={<VerticalAlignBottomOutlined />}>Download Trip</Button>` | Same icon, with a label — pick one per context, not both. |
| `secondaryButton` | `<Button>{label}</Button>` | Default-style button; this instance's example label is "Cancel" but the attached `showMenu` state (a floating option list — "Route" / "Route Point") shows it can also act as a dropdown trigger, not literally a cancel action. Read the actual use before assuming which. |
| trailing primary button (always present when `version` renders) | `<Button type="primary" icon={<PlusOutlined />}>Create new <DownOutlined /></Button>` | The chevron implies a dropdown of create options, not a plain click — pair with AntD `Dropdown` if the real use needs one. |

**Component-file quirk, not necessarily to replicate**: the default/secondary
buttons use `borderRadius: 6` (`button/global/borderRadius`) while the
"Cancel" and primary "Create new" buttons use `8` (`modal/global/
borderRadiusLg` — a modal token, reused here, probably a copy/paste
artifact rather than an intentional two-radius button system). Flag this if
it ever produces a visibly inconsistent row rather than copying it
blindly.

**Already built independently, not yet reconciled against this component**:
`LeavePage.tsx`'s toolbar (`Last Updated On :` + `RangePicker` + `Search
Employees` `Input`) is the same shape as the `noEmpty` + `search` slots
above, arrived at before this component was read from Figma. Worth a pass
to confirm it lines up control-for-control (32px height, 8px gaps, 222px
search width) next time that page is touched, rather than assumed.

**When Figma introduces a new component not in this table**: before writing
custom UI for it, check whether it's actually a variant of something AntD
already ships (most "custom" cards/badges/toggles usually are). Add the row
here once it's settled either way.

### 3.1 Page header (standing structural rule, not a single component)

**Every page's header is a small breadcrumb trail, then a large bold title
directly beneath it — enforced from `layout/AppLayout.tsx`'s `pageTitle`
prop, not left to each page to reimplement.** Confirmed against a reference
screenshot (Figma dev-mode inspect, no shared link this time): a Roster
listing page whose breadcrumb reads "Roster" but whose title reads
"Operations Roster" — **the sidebar section name gets prefixed onto the page
name** for anything grouped under a collapsible section (Operations, Sales
Module); flat top-level items (Leave, Personal Dashboard) use just their own
name.

- Pass `pageTitle="..."` on every `<AppLayout>` call in `App.tsx`; do not
  also render the page's own duplicate `<Title>` — delete it (see the same
  commit that added this rule for the full list of pages migrated).
- **Exception — pages with their own dynamic detail header** (a record's
  name/number, often beside a status tag or actions — `ContractDetailPage`,
  `InvoiceDetailPage`/`InvoiceDetailTesting2Page`,
  `CustomerNotificationDetailPage`, `LeaveProfilePage`) leave `pageTitle`
  unset and keep their bespoke inline header. That's a different shape
  entirely, not a page-listing header — forcing it through `pageTitle` would
  mean flattening out the tag/action row beside it for no visual gain.
- **Exception — `CustomerNotificationPage`** also keeps its own inline
  title: which text to show depends on an internal `surface` toggle (the
  hidden driver-leave / personal-dashboard prototypes riding along behind
  it) that `App.tsx`'s route can't see.
- A page-level primary action button that used to sit inline beside the old
  per-page title (e.g. Manage Leave Types' "Create Leave Type") moves to sit
  alone, right-aligned, in the page's own content — not into `topBarRight`
  (that slot sits next to the *breadcrumb*, a level up, and is really for
  page-level navigation like "Return to X", not a content action).

### 3.3 Data table — read from the Leave module's own Figma file, applies app-wide

**Use `common/DataTable.tsx` for every new standard listing table.** It
wraps the bordered/radius-8 card and, when a `toolbar` is passed, glues it to
the top of that same card with a divider — never a toolbar floating in its
own row above a separately-bordered table, which is what `LeavePage.tsx` did
before this was corrected. Built explicitly so "the same table component" is
true going forward, not just a shared spec every page re-implements by hand.
Migrated so far: `LeavePage.tsx`. Not yet retrofitted onto the other pages
listed in the table below (Invoice, Customer Contracts, etc.) — they already
match most of this spec independently (see the per-file fixes two commits
back) but still hand-roll their own wrapper div rather than using the shared
component; worth doing next time one of them is touched.

Read from the "👩🏻‍🚀 Leave - HR Module" file's Leave listing table (§1) —
this is a **different Figma file** from the ATOM Business Component library
that §3.1/§3.2 came from, but the same table shape is used everywhere in
this app, so the spec applies globally, not just to Leave.

| Property | Value | Where it's enforced |
|---|---|---|
| Cell padding | **16px block, 16px inline** (`cellPaddingBlock`/`cellPaddingInline`) | AntD `Table`'s *default* size already is this — the fix was **removing `size="middle"`** (which reads the 12px/8px `...MD` tokens instead) from every main listing table, not adding a token override. |
| Row height | 54px for a single-line cell (16 + 22 line-height + 16) | Falls out of the padding + `Typography`'s line-height once the size prop above is corrected; a cell with its own two-line content (e.g. a "time ago" caption under a date) is taller by design, not a bug. |
| Border color | `#f0f0f0` (`components/table/component/bordercolor`) | Already correct almost everywhere via `main.tsx`'s `ConfigProvider` Table token; one page (`CustomerContractsPage.tsx`) had drifted to `#e8e8e8` and was corrected to match. |
| Header background / text | `#fafafa` bg, **`rgba(0,0,0,0.88)`** text, **font-weight 600** | `headerColor` in `main.tsx`'s `ConfigProvider` was `#595959` (a judgment call made before this was read from Figma) — corrected to the exact token. Font-weight has no Table component token in AntD, so it's a global CSS rule in `index.css` instead. |
| Column divider | A 0.5–1px vertical line at each header cell boundary | Was reinvented three times independently as page-scoped `<style>` blocks with three different class names (`leave-table`, `notif-table`, `invoice2-table`) before this was traced to one Figma spec — consolidated into one global rule in `index.css`, removed from every page that had its own copy. |
| Table container | White bg, `1px solid #f0f0f0` border, **8px** radius, `overflow: hidden` | Every main listing table already wrapped itself this way independently; the radius was consistently `10px` (another pre-Figma judgment call) — corrected to `8px` app-wide. |

**Deliberately not touched**:
- Tables using `size="small"` (trip lists inside drawers/detail-page nested
  cards, month-usage tables, etc.) — this spec is for the page-level "Main"
  listing table (the Figma instance's own `table` prop is literally
  `"Main"`), not every nested compact list. Bumping those to 16/16 padding
  would blow out drawer layouts for no benefit the reference asked for.
- `personaldashboard/PersonalDashboardLeaveTab.tsx` — excluded per a
  standing, explicit instruction to leave that file alone (it's slated for a
  separate rebuild), even though its three tables still say `size="middle"`.
- Per-cell inline font sizes (many cells render `<Text style={{ fontSize:
  13 }}>` where the spec calls for 12px) — inline styles win over any CSS
  rule, so a real fix means editing each column's `render` function, not a
  global rule. Not done in this pass; flagged here rather than silently
  left inconsistent.

### 3.4 Drawers Template / form field-row pairing — read from "Personal Dashboard - HR Module"

Read from the "Create Leave Type" business component (§1, nodes
`39283:133569` / `39282:89715`) while auditing `LeaveTypeDrawers.tsx` against
it. Applies to every drawer built from the same vertical-form pattern
(`_Form / Form Item / Vertical` fields stacked in a `Drawer`), not just Leave
Type — check a new form drawer against this before inventing its row layout.

| Property | Value | Where it's enforced |
|---|---|---|
| Field row pairing | Two related fields that fit side by side (e.g. a name + its own entitlement-like field) sit in the **same row**, not stacked as two full-width fields | `CreateLeaveTypeDrawer`'s Leave Type + Entitlement were two stacked full-width `Field`s before this was read from Figma; now a `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` row, 12px gap. |
| Date-range row gap | **16px** between two fields that are always a pair (e.g. Effective Date / End Date) | Was `12px` (a guess) in both `CreateLeaveTypeDrawer` and `EditLeaveTypeDrawer`; corrected to the measured Figma gap in both. |
| A number input + its unit selector | Two **independently-rounded** controls with an **8px** gap — not an AntD `Space.Compact` merged-border pair | Both drawers used `Space.Compact` (square inner corners) before this was read; now a plain flex row, `gap: 8`, each control keeping its own `border-radius`. |
| Single-choice field with >2 options | A `Select` (dropdown), not a `Radio.Group` list, once there are more than 2 options | `Employee Eligibility` (4 options) was a `Radio.Group` — wrong independently of Figma, since `MOVE-3221`'s own field table says "Dropdown"; the Figma component confirms it as a single-select combobox. `Supporting Document` (2 options, Required/Optional) correctly stays `Radio.Group` — Figma and the ticket both still call it Radio there. |
| Drawer width / outer padding | Figma's own frame reads 684px wide with 32px padding | **Deliberately not copied onto the `Drawer` width.** Every drawer in the app (17+ call sites) uses the established 480/520 convention; this looks like the mockup canvas size for this one component, not an instruction to widen every drawer in the app. Only the internal field layout above was corrected. |
| Invalid-submit feedback | A `message.error` toast, in addition to whatever inline field error already existed | Found missing on `EditLeaveTypeDrawer`, `CreateClaimDrawer` (Personal Dashboard Claims) and `CreateLeaveApplicationDrawer` (Personal Dashboard Leave) — each already had inline field states but no toast. Added to all three, same `message.error` pattern already used elsewhere in the app (`CreateGroupModal.tsx` etc.). |

**Applied beyond Leave Type**, on request, to the two "Create X" form drawers
in Personal Dashboard:

- `employeeportal/EmployeePortalClaimsDrawers.tsx`'s `CreateClaimDrawer` —
  Receipt Date/Receipt Time were sitting in a plain `<Space>` (each control at
  its own intrinsic width) rather than an evenly-split row — converted to the
  same `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr`, 16px-gap shape as Effective Date /
  End Date above.
- `employeeportal/EmployeePortalLeaveDrawers.tsx`'s `CreateLeaveApplicationDrawer`
  needed more than a gap fix: its own ticket (`MOVE-3946` §2) says outright
  "all fields and logic same as apply leave drawer in leave module
  (`MOVE-3777`)", but it had drifted onto a single `DatePicker.RangePicker`
  under one "Leave Application Period" label, with a separate, disconnected
  AM/PM-only row below — not the two-column Start Date / End Date (each
  paired with its own AM/PM half) that `leave/LeaveApplicationDrawers.tsx`'s
  `ApplyLeaveDrawer` already has. Rebuilt to match: two `Form.Item`s in a
  `1fr 1fr` grid, each wrapping a `noStyle` date field + half-day `Select` in
  an 8px-gap flex row; every field but Leave Type disabled until a type is
  picked; the end date clears when the start date changes; the balance
  preview shows Available / To Deduct / Balance per year, not a bare single
  "Deduction" line. A user screenshot of the still-old drawer is what caught
  this — the earlier "just fix the gap" pass had read the file's own
  isolation note (no shared component with the HR drawer) as license to leave
  the field *shape* alone, which was wrong: isolation means no shared code,
  not a different shape than the ticket specifies.

Their AM/PM half-day fields stay `Select` (now matching the HR drawer, not
`Radio.Group`), and the Leave-Type/Claims-Type fields were already `Select`,
so no change was needed there.

## 4. Figma file conventions

**"👩🏻‍🚀 Personal Dashboard - HR Module" (`1FCRdGhHru6czP5P6h06kH`) page structure** — read via a page-discovery `use_figma` call before building anything here:

| Page | Holds |
|---|---|
| `🧩 Component` | The file's local component library — Button, Select, DatePicker, Radio, Tag/Status, Input/Textarea, Upload/Button, Form Label/Item Vertical, Tab/Tab Group, Detail Page Template, and feature-specific sets like `Apply Leave`, `Create Leave Type`, `Leave Type Detail Drawer`, `Employee`. These are **local** components (not an imported team library — `get_libraries` on this file shows no business-component library added), so reuse them by `findOne`/traversal within this file, not `importComponentByKeyAsync` against a remote library. |
| `🏭 Production` | Finished screens built from those components — includes multiple `Apply Leave` and `Create Leave Type` instances, and a `Leave Listing` full-page screen (sidebar + table). |
| `🧑‍🍳 Kitchen` | Work-in-progress screens, not yet promoted to Production. |
| Numbered pages (e.g. `Page 9`) | Blank pages the user hands over as a target for a specific code→Figma task — check `get_metadata` on the given node-id first; a `<canvas>` with no children means "build here." |

**Code→Figma pushes land in their own page/frame, not inside Production/Kitchen**, unless the user says otherwise — see `FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md`'s entry for exactly what was pushed to `Page 9` and why the pre-existing `Apply Leave` component there was deliberately left untouched.

**Critical `use_figma` gotcha found in this file — "SF Pro" does not rasterize for new text nodes.** Existing component instances in this file use "SF Pro" (Semibold/Regular) and it renders fine for them, and `figma.loadFontAsync({family:"SF Pro",...})` succeeds with no error — but any **new** `figma.createText()` node given that font reports `width: 0` forever (even after explicitly setting `layoutSizingHorizontal = 'HUG'` or calling `.resize()`), and renders as **fully invisible** in `get_screenshot` — structurally correct frames/tables/buttons all render, only the text glyphs are silently blank. Confirmed via `figma.listAvailableFontsAsync()` that "SF Pro" "Regular"/"Semibold" are listed (so it's not a missing-font-name issue) — the font just doesn't rasterize for plugin-created content in this environment. **Switch to `{family:"Inter", style:"Regular"}` / `{family:"Inter", style:"Semi Bold"}`** for any text created via `use_figma` — confirmed working (auto-measures correctly, renders correctly) with otherwise-identical code. Re-check this with a one-node smoke test (`createText`, set font+characters, read `.width` — non-zero means it works) before a big build if a different file/font is involved; don't assume it's fixed just because `loadFontAsync` didn't throw.

**4.1 Rebuilding the Leave listing screen from the real "HR General Screen" template + table, not hand-drawn primitives.** The first Leave-tab push (§ above, frame `41038:6`) was hand-drawn with manual auto-layout — acceptable for a first pass, but the user later pointed at the file's actual listing template (`41042:45004`, "HR General Screen", inside top-level "Frame 1" `41042:45003`), its filled example ("Manage Leave Types", `41042:48107`), and its table component (`41042:54541`, "Leave") and asked for the hand-drawn version to be rebuilt from those real components instead — this is exactly the `figma-fidelity` skill's "use the real structure, don't approximate it" rule applied to a Figma-side build, not just a code-side one. The rebuild (new frame, same page: `41048:645`) works like this:

- **Clone the raw template** (`41042:45004`, keeps the `Tab/Tab Group` instance) as the screen shell, rather than the filled example — the filled example has its tab bar *removed*, not just hidden, for that variant.
- **The `Tab/Tab Group` instance cannot have its children added/removed directly** — Figma disallows structural `remove()`/`clone()` on an *instance's* children (only on a plain frame's). Fix: `tabGroup = tabGroup.detachInstance()` first (converts the wrapper to a frame; its own nested `Tab/Tab Item` instances stay full instances and remain freely clonable/removable), *then* trim/clone/reorder tabs. Reorder with `insertChild(0, node)`, not by hand-setting `.x` — the group is an auto-layout (`HORIZONTAL`) frame with fill-sized children, so manual `.x`/`.resize()` on children is silently overridden by the next layout pass; only child *order* and *count* are yours to control.
- **Clone the filled example's populated card** (`41042:48118` — title row + real `Table`-component instance, not the empty-state "Custom Leave Types" card) once per card needed (3×: Leave Applications, Leave Balances, Pending My Approval), instead of trying to hand-fill the raw template's `{{CONTENT}}` placeholder slots.
- **The table's header row and each data row hold 6 cell instances, not 5** — a `_Table / Table Item / Header Item` (header) / `Table / Table cell` (data) per column, where column 5 and column 6 swap which index is hidden vs visible between the header row and the data rows (a pre-existing authoring quirk, not something the rebuild introduced). Don't assume a fixed array index is "the hidden one" — filter by `.visible !== false` and sort the remainder by `.x` to get a reliable left-to-right column order, for both the 5-visible-column and the unhide-the-6th-for-a-6-column-table cases.
- **A table cell's rendered text can come from more than one text node even when `get_metadata`/a tree-walk shows exactly one.** The last-column cell in the source table is a "Last Updated On" archetype (`componentProperties` include `Text Content` *and* `Text 2 Content`, a `Tag 2` boolean, icon toggles) with a secondary relative-time subtext line (`"16 Days ago"`) living as a sibling of the primary text, not nested under it — set both `Text Content` *and* hide/replace the secondary line's node (or it leaks the source table's "X Days ago" placeholder into an unrelated column like "Status"/"Remaining").
- **`get_screenshot` (the official Figma MCP) looked stale/wrong after this rebuild, both to this session and to the user's own open Figma tab** — see §4.2, this turned out to be a real, resolved finding, not just "give it a minute."
- `41038:6` (the old hand-drawn listing) and `41039:89` (the old hand-drawn details drawer) have since been **deleted**, once §4.2's fix made a trustworthy screenshot possible — see the next entry and `FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md`.

**4.2 Two different Figma MCP servers in this session gave genuinely different answers about the same file — prefer the Figma Desktop Bridge plugin (`mcp__Figma_Southleft__*`) for anything in this file, per explicit user instruction.** After the §4.1 rebuild, the user sent a screenshot of their own Figma tab showing the breadcrumb/title/tabs still as `{{Title}}`/`{{Module Name}}`/`Current Route` placeholders — while this session's own `node.characters` reads (via the official `mcp__Figma__use_figma`) consistently reported the correct new content, and even a from-scratch full-text-node dump of the frame (100 text nodes) showed nothing placeholder-shaped anywhere. Both couldn't be right. Once the user re-paired the **Figma Desktop Bridge** plugin (`mcp__Figma_Southleft__*`, a separate MCP server from the official `Figma` one — see the Key Technical Concepts distinction elsewhere in this session) and asked that it be used from then on, its `figma_capture_screenshot` (which calls the plugin's own `exportAsync`, i.e. renders from the live document the user has open, not a server-side export pipeline) showed the **correct** content immediately and consistently, matching every property read. Practical takeaways for this file going forward:
  - **Use `mcp__Figma_Southleft__figma_execute` for writes and `figma_capture_screenshot` for verification in this file**, not the official Figma MCP's `use_figma`/`get_screenshot` — confirmed reliable where the official MCP's screenshot tool was not, for reasons this session could not fully pin down (possibly a server-side render/export cache on the official MCP's side that lags behind rapid plugin-driven edits; possibly specific to this file/session). Re-pair with `mcp__Figma_Southleft__figma_pair_plugin` (returns a 6-character code, expires in 5 minutes, entered into the Desktop Bridge plugin's Cloud Mode toggle) whenever `figma_diagnose` reports the bridge disconnected.
  - **`figma_execute` cannot resolve a deeply-nested compound instance node ID directly** (e.g. `getNodeByIdAsync("I123:456;789:10;...")` on a long chain reliably timed out at 5–30s) — fetch the nearest real top-level ID instead and reach the target by `.children.find(...)`/a small recursive walk from there. This is the opposite of the official MCP, which resolved those same compound IDs instantly — another data point that the two servers' plugin execution environments are not equivalent for this file.
  - **A single `figma_execute` call doing many `figma.loadFontAsync` calls (one per text edit) can itself time out** — cache loaded fonts by `family|style` in a `Set` within the script and only call `loadFontAsync` once per unique font, rather than once per text node.
  - The same `detachInstance()`-before-structural-edit rule from §4.1 applies here too (hit again when cloning a second `RT-Details Content Sub-Section` into the `Drawers Template` instance for the drawer rebuild below).

**4.3 Rebuilding the Leave Application Details drawer from the real "Leave Type Detail Drawer" template, after the code itself was found not to match it.** The user pointed at `41060:69354` ("Leave Type Detail Drawer", built from the `Drawers Template` component, `41060:69367`) as what this drawer's structure should look like — a bold section header ("Basic Information" / "Additional Information") followed by 2-column `Group Content Cell` rows (label above bold value, two per row, divider between rows), with several further `Group Content Cell`s per section pre-built but hidden, ready to be shown when there's more data to display. `EmployeePortalLeaveDrawers.tsx`'s `LeaveApplicationDetailsDrawer` was using AntD `Descriptions column={1} bordered` instead — a single-column bordered table, a different shape entirely, not just a styling gap. Fixed in both places:
  - **Code**: added `DetailRow`/`DetailCell` plus `LBL`/`VAL`/`SECTION_TITLE` style constants to `EmployeePortalLeaveDrawers.tsx`, matching the label/bold-value/divider pattern already used by `ContractDetailPage.tsx` and others in this codebase (so this was reusing an existing app-wide convention, not inventing a new one) — see the Leave Application row in `FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md` for the exact field/row breakdown and the status-dependent hide/show logic (Approved/Rejected/Cancelled each reveal a different extra row, Employee always shows last).
  - **Figma**: cloned `41060:69354`, then cloned its one `RT-Details Content Sub-Section` a second time (`detachInstance()` on `Drawers Template` first — same instance-children restriction as §4.1/§4.2) to get two sections, retitled "Basic Information" / "Additional Information", filled their `Group Content Cell → Content Cell → Label/Value` pairs, and hid the unused extra cells (left available, matching the code's own hide/show). The header's action button already carries `Type`/`Danger` variant properties — set `Danger: "True"`, `Type: "Default"` to match the code's `<Button danger>Cancel Leave</Button>`, rather than overriding fill colors by hand. Also hid each content cell's own `Sub-body content wrapper` ("X ago" relative-time subtext) since the code doesn't render that — keeping the mockup honest about current code, not more polished than it.

**4.4 Rebuilding the Apply for Leave drawer — `_Form / Form Item / Vertical`'s `Type` variant, and a `layoutWrap: "WRAP"` row container.** Reference: `41064:81688` ("Employee/Drawer"). Two reusable findings:

- **A form's row container (here, `Frame 2608909` inside `Drawers Template` → `Section 4` → `Container`) uses auto-layout `layoutWrap: "WRAP"` at a fixed width, not manual row grouping.** Each child is either one `_Form / Form Item / Vertical` instance sized to the full container width (a 1-input row) or a small sub-frame holding two side-by-side instances each roughly half-width (a 2-input row) — WRAP stacks whichever mix you give it, so the "1 or 2 inputs per row depending on the data" flexibility the user described is literally how this container already works, not something to re-implement. Building a form from this component: decide per field whether it's a solo row or belongs in a paired sub-frame, don't try to force a fixed N-column grid.
- **`_Form / Form Item / Vertical` is one component with a `Type` variant** (`Button, DatePicker, InputNumber, Password, Phone, Select, Switch, Text, Textarea, Currency, Slider, Rate, Drag and Drop, Radio Buttons, Radio Group, Checkbox Group, TimePicker`) — changing a field's shape is `instance.setProperties({ Type: "Textarea" })` on an existing clone, not swapping in a different component. Combined with the label sub-instance's own `Input Label` text and `*` (required-asterisk) child — set the asterisk's `.visible` directly, don't look for a separate "required" boolean — this made reusing the reference's own pre-built fields (relabel + retype) far faster than building each field's shape from scratch.
- **A `describe()`-style recursive dump's indentation can look flatter than the real nesting if you miscount which `c` array a node belongs to** — this session briefly mistook a reference frame's `Container → Frame 2608909 → [6 field blocks]` (three levels) for `Container → [6 field blocks]` (two levels) purely from mis-reading dense JSON, and only caught it by re-querying a specific node directly. When a clone unexpectedly "loses" children that were clearly in an earlier dump, re-verify the exact parent/child relationship by ID before assuming data loss.

**4.5 Building a §3.2 `FilterBar 3.0` row and a `Segmented` year-toggle — no ready component for either, both hand-composed from primitives already mapped above.** Hit while adding the filter controls the Claims/Leave listing screens' tables actually have in code (search box, Select filters, a date range, a year toggle) — none of which the §4.1 rebuild had included yet, so the Figma mockup under-claimed what the real page does.

- **Checked the "🧭 COMPASS - Westpoint ATOM Design System 2.0" file** (`gbSCJ7q9FcMZsZ6d5dbrRN`, node `388:11438`, page literally named "Form") **for a dedicated FilterBar/RangePicker component — there isn't one here.** This page turned out to be the *source* page for the same `_Form / Form Item / Vertical` component (with the identical `Type` variant list from §4.4) already being reused via the Personal Dashboard file — confirming it's the same component, not a new one, and saving a future session from re-searching this file for the same thing. No new row needed in the component index for it; this paragraph *is* the mapping.
- **`_Form / Form Item / Vertical` collapses to a bare, label-less input when its `Label#515:279` property is set `false`** — `instance.setProperties({ "Label#515:279": false })` (note the `#515:279` suffix; the bare property name alone throws "Could not find a component property"). This shrinks the instance from the full label+input block down to just the input control at a clean **32px tall**, matching the `FilterBar 3.0` spec's "every control 32px tall" rule exactly — this is the actual building block for any bare filter-row control (search box, a lone Select), not a new component.
- **The real display text is a specific *named* text node, not "the first `TEXT` node found."** `findFirst(item, n => n.type === "TEXT")` on a Select-type item grabbed the required-asterisk `*` instead of the value text — because the label row's `*` is still a real (if invisible-once-`Label`-is-hidden) `TEXT` node earlier in traversal order than the actual value. The value text is reliably named `"Select"` for `Type: "Select"` items and `"Input"` for `Type: "Text"` items — search by that exact name, confirmed once via a full `findAllText` dump on one instance, not by type alone.
- **Correction (HR Claims build, §4.6): a RangePicker *does* exist** — `_DatePicker / DatePicker Input / Outlined` has a `Range` variant (`False`/`True`). `Range=True` renders the real "Start date → End date" input with a calendar icon. It is reachable inside any `_Form / Form Item / Vertical` with `Type: "DatePicker"`, and inside the filter popover's `Table Filter Multiselect` `Type=Date` slot. The hand-built date ranges below predate this finding; swap them for the real one whenever those frames are next touched. **No Segmented component was found** — the original note, kept for the year toggle:
- **No RangePicker or Segmented component was found either** — both were hand-built as plain frames: the date range as a bordered auto-layout row (`"Applied From" + "→" + "Applied To" + a cloned `Icon / CalendarOutlined`), the year toggle as a light-gray auto-layout track holding two pill sub-frames (the active one white-filled with a 1px/2px drop shadow and semi-bold text, the inactive one transparent). Named both frames with a `"(hand-built, no X component found)"` suffix so a later session doesn't mistake them for real library instances and can swap them out the moment a real component turns up.
- **A freshly-`createFrame()`'d auto-layout frame can report `height: 1` even with `counterAxisSizingMode: "AUTO"` set and real children inside it** — hit while adding the AM/PM half-day Select beside each date in the Apply for Leave drawer (a gap flagged, then filled in, from §4.4's own "known simplification" note) and again building the Balance block. Setting the sizing mode *before* `appendChild`-ing the children doesn't get retroactively applied; re-set `frame.counterAxisSizingMode = "AUTO"` (same value, just assigned again) *after* all children exist, and the real height resolves. Bottom-aligning a short bare control (the AM/PM select) next to a taller labelled one (the date field) in the same row is `counterAxisAlignItems: "MAX"` on their shared parent — the short one's missing "label row" becomes blank space above it rather than the two controls' inputs landing at different heights.
- **A table maxes out at 6 cell slots per row (§4.1)** — Claims' "Pending My Approval" sub-tab needed **7** columns (Employee/Department/Applied On/Claims Type/Amount/Remarks/Last Updated On). Fixed by cloning the row's own first cell as a 7th, same technique as adding a 6th column in §4.1, just one step further — the ceiling is "however many cells you're willing to clone," not a hard 6.

**4.6 HR Claims (epic MOVE-4021) pushed into Section 7: HR-module flows are full pages, built from the Production page's own Leave screens.** The user asked for the new "Claims" menu to be dropped into Section 7 (`41067:85352`), complete. That makes 14 frames under a "HR Claims" heading, below the Personal Dashboard Claims frames. See `FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md` for every node ID. Reusable findings:

- **The HR-module convention differs from Personal Dashboard's.** Production's Leave screens are full **1440×1024 pages with the `Side Navbar`**. A drawer slides over a 40%-black full-frame overlay (`Frame 2608968`), and a modal sits in a second overlay (`Frame 2608969`). Sources in `🏭 Production`:
  - `Leave Listing` (`39281:84757`) for the listing with the filter popover.
  - `Profile Detail Pages - Approve/Reject/Cancel Leave (Modal)` (`39324:89440` / `39312:44836` / `39312:25020`) for the drawer-plus-modal flows.

  These were cloned and re-themed; nothing was hand-drawn except where noted below. An HR-side screen should follow this full-page shape, not the content-only frames used for Personal Dashboard.
- **Table cells** (`Table / Table cell` and `_Table / Table cell` sets):
  - `_Table` has no `Text Right` variant. A `setProperties` naming a missing variant fails *after* partly applying, and can leave a cell stuck on an unrelated variant.
  - So swap each cell explicitly with `swapComponent(set.children.find(c => c.name === 'Type=Text, Size=Default, …'))` rather than `setProperties({Type})`.
  - `Type=Tag` cells hold two `Tag / Status` instances. Hide the second via `Tag 2`, then set `Status` (Default/Error/Processing/Success/Warning) and the tag text.
  - Truncate long values with `textTruncation='ENDING'` + `maxLines=1` on `FILL`-width text.
  - In `Text Right` cells a visible-but-empty `Frame 1` sibling pushes the value left. Hide it and set the `Text Wrapper` to `primaryAxisAlignItems='MAX'`.
  - The source table's "sorted column" header and cell fills are overrides; normalise them to column 0's fills.
  - 9 columns at the page's 1155px fit with widths `[115,150,125,120,125,135,85,140,160]`. Narrower widths make "Submission Date" / "Department" / "Last Updated On" headers wrap.
- **The filter popover isn't controlled by `Leave/Filter`'s own `State`.**
  - It's the nested `Filter Bar 3.0 → Table Filter with Buttons` `Active=True/False`.
  - Its `Table Filter Group` (`layoutWrap: WRAP`) holds 6 `Table Filter Multiselect` slots: show or hide them, and set `Input Label` + the `Select` placeholder text.
  - Changing a slot's `Type` usually also needs a matching `Sub-Module`, so use `swapComponent` to the exact variant.
  - The search placeholder (`Input` text) and the primary button (`Button Text`, plus `Icon Start=true`, whose default swap is already `PlusOutlined`) live in the same bar.
- **The production details drawer (`Employee` instance) must be detached and trimmed before editing.** It carries four hidden heavy sections (3–6), and every property edit re-lays-out all of them. `figma_execute` calls timed out at 30s until `detachInstance()` and deleting the hidden sections; afterwards the same edits ran in under a second.
  - Navigate with `.children.find(...)` paths (`Drawers Template → Section 1 → Sales/Row Content → Frame 450 → Group Content Cell`), not `findAll` over the whole drawer.
  - Don't `getNodeByIdAsync` deep `I…;…` IDs; that's the same timeout as §4.2.
  - Inside, `Content Cell` takes `Label#…`/`Value#…` text properties. Its `Sub-body content wrapper → Text 2` (`Text#…`) is the grey sub-line, used for Department under Employee and the time under Receipt Date.
  - A cell's blue-underlined "link" look is a *text-level override*, not the `Long Text` variant, so it survives a variant swap. Copy fills/decoration between cells explicitly.
  - Multi-line values need the row's `counterAxisSizingMode='AUTO'` plus the value text `FILL` + `textAutoResize='HEIGHT'` up the whole chain. Otherwise text either overlaps the divider or collapses to a one-word-wide column.
- **Actions dropdown**: `BusCom-Details Action Button 2.0` `Property 1` is `Active` (open, focused outline) or `Normal` (closed). Its items are `_Dropdown Menu / Dropdown Menu Item` with `Text`, `State` (`Default/Hover/Disabled/Selected`) and `Danger`. Set all four used items explicitly by index each time; cloning one frame from another once left an item hidden.
- **No Tooltip component exists** in this file (checked Page 9 and `🧩 Component`). The disabled-action tooltip was hand-built in AntD's style (rgba(0,0,0,.85), radius 6, 13/20 Inter, white) and named `(hand-built, no Tooltip component found)`.
- **Modals**: the Leave modals' `Wrapper → Head` / `Content Wrapper` text nodes are `{See copy master list}` placeholders, set to the code's copy. `Mark as Paid` reuses `Add Leave Entitlement` (`39098:56292`): detached, Leave Type and Entitlement rows deleted, and the date pair re-labelled with its second item switched to `Type: "Text"`.
- **Form validation states**:
  - `_Form / Form Item / Vertical` has a `Caption#515:251` boolean. Its `_Input / Input Caption` takes `Text` + `Status=Error` for the red message.
  - The inner `_Select / Select Input` and `_DatePicker / DatePicker Input / Outlined` take `Status=Error`.
  - `InputNumber` has **no** Status variant, so it gets a `#ff4d4f` stroke override.
  - A paired row needs both items `layoutSizingVertical='HUG'` before the row grows to fit a caption.
  - The `Currency` form type renders a `+48 ▾ / $ ▾` phone-style addon pair. That isn't the code's plain `$` prefix, so Amount stays `InputNumber` with "$ 0.00".
  - The error toast is the page's own `Toaster Pop-up Message` (`Message` `Type=Error`), moved to the top of the z-order with `appendChild`.
  - An uploaded-file row comes from `Leave/Modal Upload`'s `Uploaded` variant (`Name Wrapper`, `33056:32130`: paperclip + filename + ×). The `Upload / Drag and Drop` component itself has no file list.
- **Code aligned to Figma**: the `Tag / Status` component only offers AntD's preset statuses. So `HR_CLAIM_STATUS_COLOR` (`hrclaims/HrClaimDrawers.tsx`) moved from free colours (gold/cyan/blue) to the presets: Pending Approval `warning`, Pending Payment `processing`, Paid `success`, Rejected `error`, Cancelled `default`. Code and Figma tags now match 1:1.

## 5. States & interaction patterns

<!-- fill in the standard treatment for these, so every new drawer/table/form
     doesn't reinvent them: -->

| State | Standard treatment |
|---|---|
| Empty (no rows/data) | `Empty` with `PRESENTED_IMAGE_SIMPLE`, one-line description |
| Loading | <!-- fill in — this codebase has no backend/async, so likely N/A. Confirm. --> |
| Disabled action (e.g. Confirm button pending required input) | Grey out the button (`disabled`), never hide it |
| Error / validation | AntD `Form` inline validation messages; red text under the field |
| Destructive action confirmation | `Modal` with `danger` OK button, required reason for the more consequential action (e.g. Reject needs a reason, Cancel does not — see MOVE-3893/3779) |

## 7. Known deviations (code ahead of / behind Figma)

Use this section to track places where the code and Figma currently disagree
on purpose or by accident — so it's a tracked list, not something rediscovered
during the next Figma-vs-code comparison pass.

<!-- fill in, e.g. -->
- <!-- ticket / area --> — code does X, Figma shows Y, because <!-- reason -->.
- HR Claims reject/cancel modals and the drawer's "Cancel" action
  (`hrclaims/HrClaimDrawers.tsx`, same as `leave/LeaveApplicationDrawers.tsx`):
  - In code, the confirm button is `danger` (red) and stays disabled until a
    reason is typed; the "Cancel" menu item is `danger` too.
  - The Production Leave modal designs (`39312:44836` / `39312:25020`) show a
    plain primary-blue "Confirm" and a non-red "Cancel" item.
  - The Section 7 HR Claims frames keep the modal component as designed (blue
    Confirm) but show the menu item red, as in code.
  - Unresolved: it's a PM/design call whether destructive confirms should be
    red app-wide. If yes, the Figma modal needs a danger variant; if no, both
    modules' code drops `danger`.
- `MOVE-3221`/`MOVE-3559` drawers (`LeaveTypeDrawers.tsx`) — code uses the
  app-wide 480/520 drawer-width convention; the "Create Leave Type" Figma
  component's own frame is 684px wide with 32px padding. Treated as that
  component's mockup canvas size, not a width to copy — see §3.4.

## Maintenance

- Whoever changes a token or component pattern in Figma updates this file in
  the same pass, the same way `CHANGELOG.md` gets a same-commit entry for
  code changes.
- When Claude is asked to build a screen or component against Figma, this
  file is read first; gaps found while building get filled in as part of
  that work, not left for later.
