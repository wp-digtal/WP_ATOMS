## [Unreleased]

### Added — Claim (HR Module) Figma file: missing states, flow rows, titles and notes; `code-to-figma` skill

At the user's request ("cek kembali tiket claim … tambahkan state/flow yang kurang, susun rapi, beri title dan informasi"), the HR Claims section
(`Gp7MfEP0XEv8YqZ9q474sj`, `29013:27819`) was audited against MOVE-4021's tickets and their latest edits, then completed:

- **New states**: empty search result; submitted-back-on-listing; the Others variant; approved and rejected results (stays on drawer);
  reject/cancel reason filled; cancelled (drawer closes to listing); Mark as Paid missing fields, filled and paid (with the
  MOVE-3801 Mark as Paid On/By rows).
- **Layout**: six flow rows (Listing · Submit · Details by status · Approve/Reject · Cancel · Mark as Paid). Each row has a
  `Docs/Big Title` + `Docs/Notes` header with the ticket keys and rules, every frame a step caption, and arrows between steps.
  There is also a section title block with the status legend. Notes copy was re-checked against the code.
- **Why a skill**: the user asked for this standard to be remembered for every future "code / screen / HTML to Figma" request.
  It lives in `.claude/skills/code-to-figma/SKILL.md`; the layout techniques are in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §4.7.

### Changed — HR Claims: "Mark as Paid On/By" (MOVE-3801, 7 Oct 2026 edit)

MOVE-3801's 7 Oct edit adds two rows to the details drawer's Additional
Information. They show only when status = Paid: **Mark as Paid On** (date and
time) and **Mark as Paid By** (user). `HrClaim` gains
`markedPaidOn`/`markedPaidBy`, set by the Mark as Paid modal. The seeded paid
claims carry them too (Nadia Rahmawati, Finance).

The same day's edits to MOVE-3798 and MOVE-3957 needed no code change:
- MOVE-3957 only named the modal header "Mark Claim as Paid", already used.
- MOVE-3798 adds a note that claims by inactive employees stay visible in the
  listing; they just can't be picked in the Employee filter. That is already
  how the listing behaves.

**Open item**: MOVE-3798's new wording says the Employee filter lists
"employee status = active / inactive". That reads like a slip for "active /
suspended" (MOVE-3799's definition of active), given the very next sentence
says inactive employees *can't* be filtered. The code keeps
Active + Suspended.

### Added — HR Claims screens in Figma (Section 7); status tags aligned to the design system

At the user's request, the new "Claims" menu (epic MOVE-4021) was pushed into
Figma file `1FCRdGhHru6czP5P6h06kH`, Section 7 (`41067:85352`), "complete".
That is 14 full-page frames under their own heading, below the Personal
Dashboard Claims frames:
- 3 listing states: default, filter open, Pending Approval highlight active.
- 2 Submit Claim states: Toll (ERP) filled, and submitted empty with errors.
- 5 claim-details statuses: Pending Approval and Pending Payment (both with
  the Actions menu open), Paid, Rejected, Cancelled.
- 4 modals: Approve, Reject, Cancel, Mark as Paid.

They're built by cloning the Production page's own HR Leave screens (full
page + sidebar, drawer and modal overlays), not drawn from scratch. Node IDs
are in `FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md`; techniques and gotchas are in
`FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §4.6.

**Code change from what Figma showed**: `HR_CLAIM_STATUS_COLOR` moved from
free colours (gold/cyan/blue/red) to AntD's preset statuses
(warning/processing/success/error/default). The design system's
`Tag / Status` component only has those five, so code and Figma tags now
match. Verified in the browser.

**Correction recorded**: §4.5 said no RangePicker component exists. It does,
as the `Range=True` variant of `_DatePicker / DatePicker Input / Outlined`.

**Open item**: the Leave Production modal designs show a primary-blue Confirm
on reject/cancel, but both the Leave and HR Claims code use a red `danger`
Confirm. This needs a design decision, logged in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §7.

### Added — HR Claims module (epic MOVE-4021): new "Claims" sidebar menu

At the user's request, a new top-level **Claims** menu that builds all seven
stories under MOVE-4021. New files are in `src/components/hrclaims/`; the
route and menu are in `App.tsx` and `layout/AppLayout.tsx`.

- **MOVE-3797 Claims Highlight**: Pending Approval and Pending Payment count
  cards. Clicking one clears every search/filter and filters the listing to
  that status.
- **MOVE-3798 Claims Listing**: Claim No. / Submission Date / Claim Type /
  Employee / Department / Remarks / Amount / Status / Last Updated On. The
  default sort is last updated, newest first; manual sort is on the 7 columns
  the ticket names. "Search Claims" matches Claim No., Claim Type and Remarks.
  The Filter popover has Employee, Department, Submitted On, Claim Type and
  Status. Last Updated On sits in the toolbar, as on the Leave listing.
- **MOVE-3799 Submit Claim drawer**: the ticket's field table, with these rules:
  - Vehicle Licence Plate shows for Carpark and Toll (ERP); Trip shows for
    Toll (ERP) only.
  - Receipt Date must be today or earlier, and Receipt Time can't be in the
    future when the date is today.
  - Attachments allow several files: PNG/JPG/JPEG/PDF, 2MB each.
    Unsupported types are rejected with a message.
  - A missing required field shows an error toast and puts the field in its
    error state.
  - Each claim gets a running `CLYYYYXXXX` number that restarts every year.
  - An employee with no approver goes straight to Pending Payment.
- **MOVE-3801 Claim Details drawer**: header is the claim number + status tag.
  It uses the Basic / Payment (Paid only) / Additional Information two-column
  pattern, with Remarks spanning both columns ("2 column layout for
  remarks"). Actions live in a dropdown, with no primary CTA.
- **MOVE-3920 Approve/Reject, MOVE-3731 Cancel, MOVE-3957 Mark as Paid**:
  - Each action has a disabled-with-tooltip state when the status doesn't
    allow it.
  - Approve → Pending Payment. Reject and Cancel both need a reason (max 120).
  - Cancel closes the drawer.
  - Mark as Paid needs a Payment Date (today or earlier) and a Payment
    Reference No. (max 50). It then shows the Payment Information section.

**Judgment call — separate data model from Personal Dashboard's Claims.**
`claims/claimsData.ts` (MOVE-3776 etc.) has an "Approved" status, Bus
Number/Route and ERP/Carpark/Taxi Claims/Others. This epic has Pending
Payment, Vehicle Licence Plate/Trip, Carpark/Taxi/Toll (ERP)/Others, claim
numbers and payment details. MOVE-3799 itself defers linking the two
("implement after personal dashboard"), so they stay separate rather than
guessing a reconciliation. Employees, departments and the approver rule
(`claimApproverOf`) are still shared, so there is one employee list.

**Fixed while verifying**: column sorting only reordered the current page.
The listing slices its own rows, so AntD's comparator saw 10 rows, not the
whole list. Sorting is now controlled and applied before paging. The same
latent bug is in `leave/LeavePage.tsx` and is not fixed here; it is recorded
in `CLAUDE_SESSION_CONTEXT.md` §4.6.

**Open items for the PM**
- Every toast, modal and tooltip text points at the Lark "copy master list",
  which this session can't open. The text used here is a placeholder.
- MOVE-4021's own description has an older field table: auto-filled Date,
  Full Name, Bus Number, Route, Remarks required at 1000 chars, and
  ERP/Carpark/Others. It contradicts MOVE-3799 (edited 6 Oct), so MOVE-3799
  was followed.
- Trip is a free-text input in MOVE-3799 (max 120), but MOVE-3801 displays it
  as "route code (start time)", e.g. "WP 1 (3:00 PM)", which implies
  structured data. It was built as free text, with that example as the
  placeholder.
- Amount is required with a default of 0. $0.00 is treated as missing
  (it must be > 0).
- MOVE-3957 biz req 2 says "when user clicks on 'cancel' → open mark as paid
  modal", and biz req 3 says "confirm" while the CTA is "Save". Both read as
  copy-paste slips. MOVE-3731/3920 also link to MOVE-3964 (the Personal
  Dashboard drawer) rather than MOVE-3801.
- There is no permission model in this prototype, so every action is
  available to the current user.
- Vehicle Licence Plate options reuse the mock fleet list
  (`CLAIM_BUS_FLEET`). No tenant vehicle registry exists here.

### Fixed — Claim Details drawer rebuilt to the same Basic/Additional Information pattern as Leave

While recreating every Personal Dashboard screen in Figma (starting with
Claims) against the real components, found that `ClaimDetailsDrawer` still
used the AntD `Descriptions bordered column={1}` pattern — the exact gap
`MOVE-3965` already fixed for the Leave module's equivalent drawer, just
not yet applied here.

`EmployeePortalClaimsDrawers.tsx`: duplicated the `DetailRow`/`DetailCell`
+ `LBL`/`VAL`/`SECTION_TITLE` helpers from `EmployeePortalLeaveDrawers.tsx`
(not shared — this module's own isolation rule). Basic Information pairs
Employee/Department, Receipt Date/Receipt Time, Amount/Remarks, then
Attachments alone; Additional Information always shows Applied On/By, then
exactly one of Approved On/By, Rejected On/By (+ Reason for Rejection), or
Cancelled On/By (+ Reason for Cancellation) depending on `claim.status` —
no separate Employee row here, since Claims already shows it in Basic
Information. `CreateClaimDrawer` was already correctly gridded (same audit
as Leave's apply drawer) and needed no change.

Figma: rebuilt the Claims listing, claim details drawer, and submit-claim
drawer in a new target section, all cloned from the already-built Leave
equivalents and re-themed with Claims' own fields/data — see
`FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md` for the full breakdown per screen.

### Fixed — Applied `MOVE-3779`/`MOVE-3893` edits (Sunday morning backlog check)

User asked for a check of every Personal Dashboard-related ticket from
Sunday morning onward, since the nightly `MOVE-3410` watch hadn't moved its
watermark past 29 Sep. Three tickets had edited descriptions in that window:

- **`MOVE-3779`** ([Leave Profile] Cancel Leave, edited 04 Oct 01:14) — the
  Actions-menu label is "Cancel", not "Cancel Leave".
- **`MOVE-3893`** ([Leave Profile] Approve/Reject Leave Application, edited
  04 Oct 01:03/01:08) — "Approve"/"Reject", not "Approve Leave"/"Reject
  Leave"; a wording-only clarification to "in additional information
  *section*" needs no code change.
- **`MOVE-3889`** (Leave Application Details Drawer, edited 04 Oct 00:49/00:50)
  — one edit was pure table reflow (no real change); the other formalizes
  "Reason for Rejection"/"Reason for Cancellation" falling back to `-` when
  blank, which the drawer (rebuilt earlier this session) already does.

Renamed the menu/button labels in both places that mirror this HR-side
spec: `leave/LeaveApplicationDrawers.tsx`'s Actions dropdown (`Approve Leave`
→ `Approve`, `Reject Leave` → `Reject`, `Cancel Leave` → `Cancel` — all
three move together even though only `MOVE-3779`'s diff literally mentions
"Cancel", since `MOVE-3893`'s own edit made the identical change to the
other two items in the same menu) and `employeeportal/EmployeePortalLeaveDrawers.tsx`'s
standalone Cancel button (`Cancel Leave` → `Cancel`). Registered in
`WhatsNew.tsx` (`action-labels-trimmed`) and pinned to the Actions dropdown,
and the registry's watermark/window moved to 4 Oct 2026.

The Figma "Leave Application Details" drawer's button was re-synced to
"Cancel" too, once the Desktop Bridge plugin was re-paired (it had
disconnected partway through this fix).

### Fixed — Leave Application Details drawer (MOVE-3965) rebuilt to match its Figma component instead of a generic bordered table

User flagged, with a screenshot of the running app, that this drawer's layout
was wrong — it used AntD `Descriptions column={1} bordered`, a single-column
label/value table, when the actual Figma reference ("Leave Type Detail
Drawer") is a "Basic Information" / "Additional Information" pattern: a bold
section header followed by 2-column rows (label above bold value, two per
row), with a divider between rows and further rows that show or hide
depending on how much data there is.

`EmployeePortalLeaveDrawers.tsx`'s `LeaveApplicationDetailsDrawer`:

- Added `DetailRow`/`DetailCell` plus `LBL`/`VAL`/`SECTION_TITLE` style
  constants, matching the label/bold-value/divider pattern `ContractDetailPage.tsx`
  and other existing pages already use for the same Figma component — this
  reuses an established app convention, it isn't a new one.
- **Basic Information**: Dates + Days Used (row 1), Remarks + Supporting
  Document (row 2) — same fields as before, now paired instead of stacked.
- **Additional Information**: Created On + Created By always; then exactly one
  of Approved On/By, Rejected On/By (+ a Reason for Rejection row), or
  Cancelled On/By (+ a Reason for Cancellation row), depending on
  `app.status`; Employee always last. This is the hide/show behavior the
  Figma component's own hidden `Group Content Cell` rows are built for.

Verified in the browser (Pending Approval shows 2 rows; Approved reveals the
extra Approved On/By row) and in Figma, where the drawer was rebuilt from the
real `Drawers Template` + `Group Content Cell` components — see
`FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md` and `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §4.3.

### Fixed — Personal Dashboard's Apply Leave drawer rebuilt to match the HR Apply Leave drawer it's specified to copy

Follow-up correction to the entry directly below. The user sent two
screenshots of the still-unchanged "Apply for Leave" drawer in Personal
Dashboard and asked why it hadn't moved — the previous pass had only
evened out a `<Space>`-wrapped field pair, leaving the drawer's actual field
*shape* untouched: a single `DatePicker.RangePicker` under "Leave Application
Period", with a disconnected AM/PM-only row below it, rather than the HR
module's two-column Start Date / End Date (each paired with its own AM/PM
half). `MOVE-3946` §2 says outright "all fields and logic same as apply
leave drawer in leave module (`MOVE-3777`)" — this isn't a style preference,
it's what the ticket requires, and `leave/LeaveApplicationDrawers.tsx`'s
`ApplyLeaveDrawer` is the already-fixed reference for that exact shape.

Rebuilt `employeeportal/EmployeePortalLeaveDrawers.tsx`'s
`CreateLeaveApplicationDrawer`:

- Replaced the single `dateRange` RangePicker field with separate `startDate`
  / `endDate` fields, each paired with its own AM/PM `Select` (not
  `Radio.Group`), in a `1fr 1fr` grid with 16px gap — matching
  `ApplyLeaveDrawer` field-for-field.
- Every field but Leave Type now starts disabled and enables once a type is
  picked; changing the start date clears a stale end date — same two fixes
  already applied to the HR drawer for `MOVE-3777`'s 23 Sep revision.
- The balance preview now shows **Available / To Deduct / Balance** per
  year the application spans, replacing the single bare "Deduction" line —
  matching `MOVE-3777`'s current field table exactly, not an earlier
  snapshot of it.
- Kept this file's own stated isolation rule (no shared component with the
  HR drawer) — the fields are freshly written here, not imported, since that
  rule is about not sharing *code*, not an excuse to drift from the ticket's
  required *shape*.

Recorded the correction in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3.4.

Verified live in Chromium: Start Date / End Date now render side by side
exactly like the HR drawer, the Available/To Deduct/Balance block renders
correctly for a cross-field test (Annual Leave, 10–15 Oct 2026), end date
clears on start date change, and a leave type requiring a document (Study
Leave) still correctly blocks submit with both the inline error and the
toast. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Fixed — Create Leave Type's drawer-pattern fixes extended to Personal Dashboard's two Create drawers

User confirmed the "Create Leave Type" Figma pattern recorded in
`FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3.4 and asked to apply it in Personal Dashboard.
Audited the module's two "Create X" form drawers — `CreateClaimDrawer`
(`employeeportal/EmployeePortalClaimsDrawers.tsx`) and
`CreateLeaveApplicationDrawer` (`employeeportal/EmployeePortalLeaveDrawers.tsx`)
— against the same checklist already used for Leave Type:

- **Receipt Date / Receipt Time** (Claims, shown only for Taxi Claims) were
  sitting in a `<Space size={16}>`, which leaves each `DatePicker`/`TimePicker`
  at its own intrinsic width rather than splitting the row evenly. Converted
  to the same `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr`, 16px-gap row used for
  Effective Date / End Date.
- **Missing error toast on an invalid submit** — both drawers had inline
  field feedback already (AntD's own required-field highlighting, plus
  Claims' own `fileError` text and Leave's own "requires a supporting
  document" text) but no toast. Added `message.error` on a failed
  `form.validateFields()` and on a missing required attachment, in both
  drawers, matching the pattern already used elsewhere in the app. Also
  removed a dead `form.setFields([{ name: 'leaveTypeId', errors: [] }])`
  call in the Leave drawer that set an empty error array on an unrelated
  field and had no visible effect.
- Checked AM/PM (2 options → `Radio.Group` is correct) and the Leave
  Type / Claims Type selects (already `Select`) — no change needed, since
  the pattern's "Select once >2 options" rule doesn't apply to either.

Recorded in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3.4 as the pattern's first reuse
outside Leave Type.

Verified live in Chromium: Receipt Date/Time now split evenly for Taxi
Claims, and both drawers show an error toast on an invalid submit.
`npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Fixed — Applied a backlog of `MOVE-3410` ticket edits missed by the nightly Jira watch

User asked to check for Personal Dashboard changes "in the last 4 days." Epic
`MOVE-3412`'s own 21 child tickets genuinely have no edits (`updated` still
reads 14 Sep 2026 on every one) — but a text search for "Personal Dashboard"
turned up three `MOVE-3410` (Leave epic) tickets, edited as recently as
1 Oct 2026, that implement screens surfaced in Personal Dashboard's Leave tab:
`MOVE-3494` (Employee Leave Profile Details), `MOVE-3777` (Apply Leave), and
`MOVE-3559` (Edit Leave Type). `CLAUDE.md`'s nightly routine only watches
`MOVE-3410`, but its watermark (`WhatsNew.tsx`'s latest `on:` date) was stuck
at 18 Sep 2026 — an 11+ day gap during which all three tickets kept changing.

Most of the large structural changes (Edit Leave Entitlement/Change History
moving off the page-level actions dropdown into the new `MOVE-4137` balance
details drawer, Apply Leave becoming a secondary CTA) turned out to already
be built — reading the diff-since-14-Sep in isolation would have over-stated
the gap, since the pages were evidently last rebuilt against a later ticket
snapshot than the watermark suggests. Re-reading each ticket's *current* text
against the *current* code surfaced a smaller, concrete set of real gaps:

- **`MOVE-3777` (22 Sep edit):** "Deduction" renamed to "To Deduct" in the
  Apply Leave drawer's balance block.
- **`MOVE-3777` (23 Sep edit):** every field but Leave Type now starts
  disabled and enables once a type is picked (previously only the date
  pickers were gated — the AM/PM selects, Remarks and Supporting Document
  were always enabled). Changing the start date now also clears a
  previously-picked end date, rather than leaving a stale one that may no
  longer be valid against the new start.
- **`MOVE-3494` (29 Sep edit):** the Leave Applications table's "Days Used"
  column renamed to "Used"; a Time Off row now shows its hours used
  (derived from `startTime`/`endTime`) instead of a bare dash.
- **`MOVE-3559` (21 Sep edit):** Edit Leave Type was missing the error toast
  on an invalid save that Create Leave Type already had — added, reusing the
  same `message.error` pattern.
- **`MOVE-3559` (29 Sep edit):** the Edit drawer's "what changes when you
  save" list now notes that entitlement/date changes override any
  entitlement previously edited for a single employee (`MOVE-3775`).
- Checked "Childcare Leave" vs. "Unpaid Infant Care Leave" (21 Sep edit
  looked like a rename at first glance) — they are two distinct, already
  separately-modelled system leave types in `leaveData.ts`, not a rename.
  No change needed.

**Not done in this pass, flagged as open work:** `MOVE-4204` ("Apply Leave
— For Specific Leave Types") is a large, scenario-heavy ticket spelling out
leave-type-specific behaviour for all 10 leave types (validity-period
splitting, carry-forward math, non-continuous birthday-leave windows, etc.).
`ApplyLeaveDrawer`'s generic year-block logic already covers some of this
generically, but a full line-by-line audit against `MOVE-4204` was out of
scope for this pass given its size — needs its own dedicated session.

Registered every fix above in `WhatsNew.tsx`'s `LEAVE_CHANGES` registry with
a `<Mark>` on the control it affected, per the module's own convention.

Verified live in Chromium: field gating disables/enables correctly around
picking a leave type, changing the start date clears a stale end date,
"To Deduct" renders in the balance block, the applications table's "Used"
column renders, and the Edit Leave Type error toast fires on an invalid
save. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean (after `npm install` — this container started
with no `node_modules` at all).

### Fixed — Create/Edit Leave Type drawers brought in line with Figma + missed `MOVE-3221` edits

The user introduced a new Figma pattern (Personal Dashboard - HR Module file,
`39283:133569` / `39282:89715`, both resolving to the "Create Leave Type"
component's two interaction states) and asked for a careful six-point audit —
layout arrangement, position, components, padding/spacing, pixel-perfect
sizing, color/design-system tokens — against `LeaveTypeDrawers.tsx`, under the
explicit rule that layout must not change on a future content change, only
content may. They also asked for a full re-sweep of ticket coverage, which
surfaced three `MOVE-3221` edits since the drawer was first built (14, 21 and
29 Sep 2026) that had been missed.

- **Leave Type + Entitlement now share a row** (`CreateLeaveTypeDrawer`),
  matching the Figma component's two-column pairing — they were two stacked
  full-width fields before.
- **Entitlement + unit is a plain 8px-gap flex row**, not `Space.Compact` —
  Figma shows two independently-rounded controls, not a merged-border pair.
  Fixed in both Create and Edit, since both hand-rolled the same field.
- **Effective Date / End Date grid gap corrected `12px → 16px`** in both
  drawers, read directly off the Figma frame's measured gap.
- **Employee Eligibility changed from a `Radio.Group` to a `Select`**
  (`CreateLeaveTypeDrawer`) — this was wrong even before the Figma reference:
  `MOVE-3221`'s own field table was edited 14 Sep 2026, changing this field's
  type from Radio to Dropdown, which the ticket-coverage re-sweep had missed
  until this pass. The Figma component confirms it as a single-select
  combobox.
- **Primary button relabelled `"Save" → "Create"`** — `MOVE-3221` was edited
  21 Sep 2026 to rename "Save create" to "Create" throughout biz req 4
  ("When user clicks 'create'"), matching what the Figma component and the
  user's screenshot both already showed.
- **Validation relaxed to allow the end date to equal the effective date** —
  `MOVE-3221` was edited 29 Sep 2026, "end date must be after" →
  "must be the same as or after". Fixed in both drawers (`badRange` and each
  `DatePicker`'s `disabledDate`).
- **Added the missing error toast on an invalid create/duplicate-name
  submit** (`message.error`, matching the pattern already used by
  `CreateGroupModal.tsx` etc.) — `MOVE-3221`'s acceptance criteria call for
  one on both outcomes; only the inline field states existed before.
- Checked `isActiveForLeave` (`leaveLogic.ts`) against the 29 Sep edit's
  clarification that "all active employees" means "status = active or
  suspended" — already correct (`MOVE-1975`/`MOVE-3890`), no change needed.
- **Judgment call, scoped deliberately:** the Figma frame's own width (684)
  and padding (32px) were *not* copied onto the Drawer itself. Every other
  drawer in the app (17+ call sites, Contracts/Notification/Invoice/Leave/
  EmployeePortal) uses the established 480/520 convention; the Figma canvas
  size here reads as this one mockup's frame, not an instruction to widen
  every drawer. Internal field layout was corrected; outer chrome was not.

Verified live in Chromium: Leave Type/Entitlement render side by side,
Employee Eligibility is a working combobox whose value flows through to the
table, a same-day effective/end date now saves successfully, and the
duplicate-name path shows the new error toast. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Added — `common/DataTable.tsx`, the shared standard-table component; applied to Leave

At the user's request, annotated directly on a screenshot of the Leave
listing: (1) use the same table component everywhere, since more "standard
tables" are coming; (2) a table's toolbar (date range filter, search, filter
icon, primary action) should always sit glued to the table, not floating in
its own row above it; (3) a sort icon only where the column is genuinely
sortable; (4) the pagination footer's own styling.

- **New `common/DataTable.tsx`** wraps the bordered/8px-radius card and, when
  passed a `toolbar`, glues it to the top of that same card with a one-line
  divider — matching how `InvoicePage.tsx` etc. already did this
  independently, but now as one shared component instead of each page
  re-implementing the wrapper by hand.
- **`LeavePage.tsx` migrated to it.** Its toolbar ("Last Updated On" +
  search + filter + "Manage Leave Types") previously sat in its own
  un-bordered row above a separately-bordered table — exactly what the
  annotation's circle-and-arrow was pointing at. Now one card.
- **Sort icons** — checked against the code rather than assumed: Leave's
  Employee/Hiring Company/Department/Last Updated On columns already define
  `sorter` and AL/ML Balance deliberately don't (a biz-req decision, not an
  oversight) — AntD's `Table` already only renders the icon where `sorter`
  exists, and `DataTable` doesn't touch that, so this was already correct;
  recorded as a requirement on the new component so it stays that way.
- **`PaginationBar.tsx`**'s card radius corrected `10px → 8px` — the one real
  drift found in the pagination footer, missed in the previous table-styling
  pass since this file lives outside any of the tables themselves.

Checked `MOVE-3412`'s 21 child tickets for changes since last read (item 5)
— none since 14 Sep 2026, nothing to apply.

Recorded in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3.3: `DataTable` is the component to
use for every new standard table going forward; not yet retrofitted onto
Invoice/Customer Contracts/etc., which already independently match most of
the spec but still hand-roll their own wrapper.

Verified live in Chromium: toolbar and table now render as one card;
searching "Ahmad" still filters to one row (filter wiring unchanged).
`npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Changed — Every main data table restyled app-wide to the Leave module's own Figma spec

At the user's request: read the Leave HR Module Figma file's own listing
table in detail (size, padding, spacing, margin), then applied it
everywhere — "content jelas mengikuti apa yang ada di module itu" (each
table's own columns/data stay exactly as they are; only the sizing changed).

- **Removed `size="middle"` from every main listing table** (Leave,
  Manage Leave Types, Leave Profile's balances/applications, Invoice,
  Invoice 2.0, Invoice Detail's adjustments/payments, Customer
  Notification(s), Customer Contracts) so they fall back to AntD Table's
  actual default padding (16px block/inline) — which **already matches**
  the Figma spec exactly; the deviation was ever opting into "middle"
  (12px/8px) in the first place, not a missing token.
- `main.tsx`'s `ConfigProvider` `Table.headerColor` corrected from `#595959`
  to the exact token, `rgba(0,0,0,0.88)`.
- `index.css` gained two global rules — header font-weight 600, and a
  vertical divider line at each column boundary — replacing three
  independent page-scoped copies of the same hack (`leave-table`,
  `notif-table`, `invoice2-table` classes, each with its own duplicated
  `<style>` block) that had drifted into existence before this was traced
  to one Figma spec.
- Table container radius corrected `10px → 8px` app-wide (`CustomerContractsPage.tsx`'s
  border color `#e8e8e8 → #f0f0f0` too, another small pre-existing drift).
- Incidental fix while in `main.tsx` for the same reason: `Menu.itemHeight`
  was `36`, 4px off the Side Navbar component's actual `40px` spec from a
  previous pass — corrected.

**Deliberately not touched** (see `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3.3 for the
full reasoning): tables using `size="small"` (nested/drawer trip lists,
month-usage tables — a different, intentionally compact shape, not what
this spec covers); `personaldashboard/PersonalDashboardLeaveTab.tsx` (excluded
per a standing instruction to leave that file alone); per-cell inline font
sizes (many cells hardcode 13px where the spec wants 12px — inline styles
can't be overridden by a CSS rule, so fixing this for real means editing
every column's `render` function, not done in this pass).

Recorded in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3.3, including a note that the Leave
HR Module Figma file is a different file from the ATOM Business Component
library §3.1/§3.2 came from.

Verified live in Chromium across two different modules (Leave, Invoice) to
confirm the fix is genuinely global, not page-local. `npx tsc --noEmit`
clean.

### Added — `FilterBar 3.0` (table toolbar) recorded in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, no build yet

At the user's request ("saya mau kamu save ini karena bisa jadi saya akan
minta kamu... di leave module") — training/recording only, no page changed.
Read the "FilterBar 3.0" ATOM Business Component (node 21:9490): the row
that sits under a page's title whenever its table has its own filters/
actions, **not every page** — the user was explicit that it depends on the
module. It's a composable bag of optional slots (a Date Selector, a search
`Input`, an icon-only filter `Button`, download buttons plain/labelled, a
secondary button that can double as a dropdown trigger, a primary "Create
new ▾" button), every control 32px tall, 8px gaps — documented slot-by-slot
in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3.2, each already mapped to the AntD primitive
it's built from.

Flagged, not fixed: `LeavePage.tsx`'s existing toolbar (Last Updated On +
Search Employees) is independently the same shape as this component's
`noEmpty` + `search` slots, arrived at before this component was read from
Figma — worth reconciling control-for-control next time that page is
touched, not assumed to already match.

### Added — `FIGMA_COMPONENT_INDEX.md`, the code → Figma direction

At the user's request: a dedicated index, separate from
`FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` (which is Figma → code — building a screen from an
existing design). This one is the other direction — before pushing this
app's UI *into* Figma ("vibe code to Figma"), read this index first so an
existing library component gets reused instead of a fresh lookalike shape
getting drawn. The user adds a row when they've identified which Figma
component a piece of app UI should be built from; Claude fills in the "Key
details" column the first time that row is actually used, by reading the
node from Figma rather than guessing.

Seeded with the two ATOM Business Components already identified this
session — `Side Navbar` (node 425:16539) and `Tab/Tab Group` (node
424:16506) — with their token-level detail already written in, so the next
code → Figma task on either has something to start from immediately.

`CLAUDE.md` and `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` both now point to it, and
`FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`'s component-mapping table gained a `Side Navbar`
row (kept brief, pointing at the index for the full breakdown).

### Fixed — Sidebar sub-item spacing, corrected against the real Figma component

Follow-up after the previous restyle: asked to check again why the sidebar
still didn't match, this time reading the actual "Side Navbar" component
node (425:16539) instead of working from a screenshot alone turned up the
real spec — and it was different from what got built:

- **Every sub-item is its own fully-rounded row** (`itemBorderRadius` 8px on
  all four corners), on a faint tint (`submenuitembg`,
  `rgba(0,0,0,0.02)`), indented to `pl-48` — double a top-level item's own
  24px indent — with the **same 4px gap between rows as everywhere else in
  the menu**. The previous pass had joined an expanded section's sub-items
  into one seamless block (radius only at the group's outer top/bottom
  edges, no gap between rows) — a reasonable-looking guess from the
  screenshot, but not what the component actually specifies.
- Bumped the whole menu's item radius from 6px to the component's actual
  8px, and the gap between every row (top-level included) from ~2px to the
  component's actual 4px (`margin: '2px 8px'` per item, so adjacent items'
  margins add up to 4px).
- The avatar's notification dot shrank from 8px to the component's actual
  6px and moved to match its exact top/right offset.

Verified live in Chromium: sub-items now render as individually rounded,
gapped, indented rows rather than one joined block. `npx tsc --noEmit`
clean.

### Changed — Every page header now follows one enforced shape (breadcrumb + bold title)

At the user's request ("setiap page selalu punya struktur seperti ini... tolong
di update dan camkan ini" — every page always has this structure, update it
and remember it): `layout/AppLayout.tsx` gained a `pageTitle` prop that
renders a large bold title directly beneath the breadcrumb, inside the same
sticky header block, instead of each page rendering its own `<Title>` deeper
in its content. Reference: a Roster listing page whose breadcrumb reads
"Roster" but whose title reads "Operations Roster" — confirming the rule is
**"{sidebar section} {page name}"** for anything grouped under a collapsible
section (Operations, Sales Module), and just the page's own name for flat
top-level items.

**Migrated to `pageTitle` (own duplicate `<Title>` removed):** Live Tracking,
Live Tracking Legacy, Live Tracking Testing, Tracking 2.0, Testing, Customer
Contracts (`pageTitle="Customer Contracts"`), Leave (`"Leave"`), Manage Leave
Types (`"Manage Leave Types"`, its "Create Leave Type" button now stands
alone, right-aligned, in place of sitting beside the old inline title),
Notifications (`"Notifications"`, its unread `Badge` now sits beside a small
"Unread" label rather than beside the old inline title), Roster Calendar
(`"Operations Roster Calendar"`), Roster Calendar 3.0 (`"Roster Calendar
3.0"`, left unprefixed since it's already off the sidebar per the Roster
module's own standing rule), **Roster 4.0 — `"Operations Roster"`, the exact
case the reference screenshot showed**, Sales Module's Live Tracking 2.0,
Invoice, Invoice 2.0, Personal Dashboard.

**Deliberately left unmigrated, `pageTitle` unset, own header kept:**
- Detail pages with a bespoke dynamic header (record name/number beside a
  status tag or actions) — `ContractDetailPage`, `InvoiceDetailPage`,
  `InvoiceDetailTesting2Page`, `CustomerNotificationDetailPage`,
  `LeaveProfilePage`. A different shape entirely from a page-listing header;
  flattening the tag/action row into a plain title would lose information,
  not just restyle it.
- `CustomerNotificationPage` — which title to show depends on its own
  internal `surface` toggle (the hidden driver-leave / personal-dashboard
  prototypes riding along behind it), which the route in `App.tsx` has no
  visibility into.

**Recorded as a standing rule** in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` §3.1, alongside
the sidebar/tab conventions already there, so it's applied by default to
every new page rather than rediscovered.

Verified live in Chromium: Roster 4.0 matches the reference exactly
(breadcrumb "Roster", title "Operations Roster"); Leave, Personal Dashboard,
Invoice, and Manage Leave Types (button relocation) all render correctly;
Customer Notification correctly keeps its thin breadcrumb-only header with
its own inline title untouched. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Changed — Sidebar restyled to match a supplied reference screenshot exactly

At the user's request, with an explicit "must not differ" — only the menu's
own content (our actual pages) was kept as-is; every structural/style detail
of the reference was replicated in `layout/AppLayout.tsx`:

- **Brand mark** — a hollow blue ring (`border: 4px solid`, transparent
  center), replacing the filled circle with a "C" initial.
- **Collapse toggle moved into the header row** as a small icon button
  (a purpose-built SVG — two panels inside a rounded frame — since it isn't
  one of AntD's stock icons), replacing `Sider`'s own default bottom-fixed
  trigger bar (now disabled via `trigger={null}`). Stays visible in the
  collapsed state too, or there would be no way back to expanded.
- **Avatar gets a small red dot** (top-right corner) and its background
  changed from blue to neutral gray, matching the reference exactly.
- **Section chevrons flipped**: down while collapsed (the direction it will
  open), up while expanded — the reference's convention is the opposite of
  what this menu had (previously a sideways/down arrow pair; a small thing,
  but "must not differ" means it too).
- **Expanded sections now render their sub-items as one continuous
  light-gray block** (rounded only at the group's outer top/bottom corners),
  not as individually-styled rows with gaps between them — `groupedSubItem()`
  computes each row's corner radius from its position (first/middle/last).

**No menu content changed** — Leave, Personal Dashboard, Operations (Roster
Calendar, Roster 4.0), Sales Module (Live Tracking 2.0, Invoice, Invoice 2.0,
Customer Notification) are all the same destinations as before, just
restyled to the reference's chrome. The reference's own example menu items
(Notifications, Roles & Permissions, Tenant, Staff, Fleet Owners/Fleets/
Drivers) were not copied in — this app has no such pages, and the ask was to
match style, not invent navigation.

Verified live in Chromium: expanded and collapsed states, and the Operations
chevron flipping between up/down on toggle. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Added — `common/PageTabs.tsx`, the ATOM Business Component tab bar; applied to Personal Dashboard

At the user's request: Personal Dashboard's top tab bar (Home/Leave/Claims/
Pay Slip) now uses a new shared component built from the Figma "ATOM -
Business Component" library's `Tab/Tab Group` ([node 424:16506](https://www.figma.com/design/ZpEYnJ4POb86CDMAM3BWCG/%F0%9F%92%8E-ATOM---Business-Component?node-id=424-16506)),
replacing the plain AntD `Tabs` it shipped with.

**The component's own Code Connect note maps it to `Anchor`, not `Tabs`.**
Figma's node description ships the exact intended code
(`<Anchor direction="horizontal" items={...} />`), and that is also *why* the
design looks the way it does: every tab item carries its own underline
segment — a full-width faint baseline plus a colored 2px segment that slides
under the active item — rather than `Tabs`' single shared baseline and ink
bar. Per the design-to-code rule ("apply Code Connect precisely at its
mapped node, reuse the connected component unless it truly can't express the
design"), `PageTabs` wraps `Anchor` rather than reskinning `Tabs` to look
similar.

`Anchor` is built for in-page scroll-spy navigation, so `PageTabs` adapts it
into ordinary content-switching tabs: clicks are intercepted
(`preventDefault`, so the browser never jumps to a `#hash`) and turned into a
controlled `activeKey` the caller owns — same shape as `Tabs`'
`items`/`activeKey`/`onChange`. The one real visual deviation from stock
`Anchor` is that Figma's items stretch to fill the bar in equal-width
segments (`Anchor` normally sizes to content and left-aligns), so that's the
only CSS override added — the baseline and active-segment behaviour are
already exactly right out of the box and are left untouched.

**`EmployeePortalPage.tsx` now holds `activeKey` itself** rather than letting
`Tabs` manage it internally, and renders every panel always-mounted
(`display:none` when inactive) rather than conditionally — preserving `Tabs`'
own default behaviour of not resetting a tab's local state (open filters, an
open drawer) when switching away and back. Verified live: switching to
Claims, typing into its search box, switching to Leave and back left the
search text intact.

**Standing rule, recorded in `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`**: use `PageTabs` for
any page-level top tab bar going forward, not `Tabs` directly — this was
asked for explicitly, not just for this one page. Not retrofitted onto
Claims' own nested "My Claims"/"Pending My Approval" sub-tabs in this pass
(a different shape — an in-panel toggle, not a page-level section switch) or
onto any other page's tab bar; flagged in the doc's mapping table as a call
worth making if this component is meant to cover that shape too.

`npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Added — Personal Dashboard: the Claims tab, correcting an earlier misread (MOVE-3776, MOVE-3943, MOVE-3945, MOVE-3958, MOVE-3964)

**This corrects a mistake, not a Jira change.** The Claims tab shipped as an
honest-looking "not specified yet" placeholder, reasoning that its tickets
"describe the Claims module itself (a separate domain, not part of this
epic's own build)". Asked to re-check why Claims was still empty when the
requirement already existed, re-reading all five tickets in full shows that
reasoning was wrong: every one of them carries a complete field table,
statuses and acceptance criteria — the same shape as the Leave tickets this
epic's Leave tab was already built from. Only MOVE-3944 (`[x]`, a cancelled
duplicate) and MOVE-3960/MOVE-3963 (`[KIV]`, notifications) are genuinely
empty; that part of the earlier read was right. Built now, from the tickets:

- **MOVE-3776 (Create Claims Submission)** — Claims Type select (ERP /
  Carpark / Taxi Claims / Others, with a required free-text field for
  Others); Receipt Date/Time shown only for Taxi Claims (date can't be
  future; time can't be future when the date is today); Bus Number shown for
  ERP/Carpark, Route shown for ERP only (not Carpark — the field table is
  explicit about the difference); Amount as a 2-decimal number input;
  Remarks (240 chars); a required attachment capped at 2MB. Bus Number/Route
  aren't stored as their own columns — per biz req 3 they're auto-appended
  into the Remarks string that the listing and details drawer actually show
  (`composeClaimRemarks` in `claims/claimsLogic.ts`). Same "no approver on
  file → created already approved" exception as Leave's MOVE-3956, because
  MOVE-3776 biz req 4 states the identical rule for claims.
- **MOVE-3943 (Submitted Claims Listing)** — "My Claims" and "Pending My
  Approval" sub-tabs, each with its own search bar, filters (Claim Type,
  Status, Applied On range, plus Employee/Department on the approval tab)
  and sort (Status alphabetical, Applied On and Last Updated On
  chronological, Last Updated On newest-first by default) — independently,
  per biz req 2/3.
- **MOVE-3964 (Claims Submission Details Drawer)** — the same isolated-drawer
  pattern as Leave's details drawer, with the attachment shown behind the
  same "prototype — nothing to download" honesty note already used there.
- **MOVE-3945 / MOVE-3958 (Approve/Reject, Cancel)** — same "manage own
  dashboard" scoping bug-fixed on Leave already: an approver reviewing
  someone else's claim from "Pending My Approval" gets Approve/Reject only,
  never Cancel. **Cancel's reason is required** (MOVE-3958's own acceptance
  criteria say so explicitly) while **Reject's is left optional**, since
  neither MOVE-3945 nor MOVE-3964 states it's required — this is a real
  difference from Leave, where a later ticket revision made rejection's
  reason required; nothing here claims Claims should match that unless a
  ticket says so.

**Judgment calls, made explicit:**
- No separate Employees-module approver field exists in this prototype, so
  the claim approver reuses `leaveApprover` (`claimApproverOf` in
  `claims/claimsLogic.ts`) rather than inventing a second, disconnected
  approver graph — the same five employees who already have pending leave
  approvals from Citra Dewi also seed her "Pending My Approval" claims.
- The Bus Number dropdown reuses the vehicle numbers already seeded in the
  Notification module (`SBS1234A` etc.) instead of inventing new plate
  numbers; the Route dropdown is a fresh, small mock list — no route data
  exists anywhere else in this codebase.
- MOVE-3964's action table says Cancel is enabled "only if pending approval",
  but MOVE-3958's own acceptance criteria say "Pending Approval **and**
  Approved". Followed MOVE-3958 as the more specific, authoritative source —
  same resolution pattern used for Leave's MOVE-3965-vs-MOVE-3889 conflict.
- "Paid" is a real status in the field table but no ticket in this batch ever
  transitions a claim into it (no payroll-integration ticket exists yet), so
  it only appears as seed data — nothing in the UI can produce it. Flagged as
  an open item below.
- MOVE-3964's Receipt Date/Time row literally says "if no remarks → display
  '-'", which reads like a copy-paste leftover from a different field's
  remark. Implemented as "if not applicable (category ≠ Taxi Claims) →
  '-'", the reading that actually makes sense, and flagged for the PM rather
  than followed literally.

**New files**: `claims/claimsData.ts`, `claims/claimsLogic.ts` (the Claims
domain's data + business rules, parallel to `leave/`), plus
`employeeportal/EmployeePortalClaimsDrawers.tsx` and
`EmployeePortalClaimsTab.tsx` — same isolation rule as the Leave tab: fresh
AntD UI, no shared component with `personaldashboard/` or the HR module.
`employeeportal/employeePortalIdentity.ts` is new too — pulled the "which
employee am I" constant (Citra Dewi, `lv-3`) out of `EmployeePortalLeaveTab.tsx`
into its own file so the Leave and Claims tabs can't drift onto different
"self" employees.

**Verified live in Chromium**: My Claims shows all 5 statuses including Paid;
Pending My Approval lists all 5 employees' claims with a working Review
action; reviewing someone else's claim shows Approve/Reject but never
Cancel; rejecting with no reason still enables Confirm (optional, as coded);
cancelling my own claim keeps Confirm disabled until a reason is entered,
then enabled; the Submit Claim drawer's fields correctly change for ERP
(Bus Number + Route), Carpark (Bus Number only), Taxi Claims (Receipt
Date/Time), and Others (free-text type). `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

**Open items for the PM**
- Should "Paid" be reachable from the UI (e.g. a payroll-linked action), or
  is it intentionally outside this ticket batch's scope?
- Should Reject require a reason like Leave's does, or is Claims' silence on
  this intentional? (Currently: optional.)
- MOVE-3964's Receipt Date/Time remark ("if no remarks → display '-'") likely
  needs correcting in Jira — it was read as a copy-paste artifact here.

### Added — `FIGMA_DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`, a reference doc for the Figma design system

At the user's request: a living template doc (tokens, Figma→AntD component
mapping, naming conventions, states, known deviations) for the user to fill
in with the actual Figma design system, so future work — building a screen
from Figma, or pushing a pattern from code back into Figma — has a single
place to check instead of re-deriving it each time. Wired into `CLAUDE.md`
alongside `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` and `CLAUDE_SESSION_CONTEXT.md` as a standing
reference to read before UI work. Currently mostly empty placeholders — the
one confirmed value is the 24px page gutter already in use across every page
component (e.g. `LeavePage.tsx`'s `padding: 24` wrapper).

### Fixed — Personal Dashboard: missing page padding (review feedback)

`EmployeePortalPage.tsx` rendered its `Tabs` straight into `AppLayout`'s
`Content`, which itself carries no padding — every other page supplies its
own via a wrapping `<div style={{ padding: 24 }}>` (see `LeavePage.tsx`), and
this one didn't. The tab bar and every card under it sat flush against the
right edge of the viewport instead of matching the left-side gutter. Added
the same wrapping div so Personal Dashboard now has the page's standard
24px gutter on both sides.

### Changed — Personal Dashboard: tidied the Claims / Pay Slip placeholder (review feedback)

The "not specified yet" placeholder on the Claims and Pay Slip tabs
(`NotSpecifiedTab` in `EmployeePortalPage.tsx`) had its explanatory paragraph
running the full width of the page — one long, hard-to-read line — with the
cited ticket keys jammed into that same sentence. Capped the text block at
440px and centered it under the `Empty` icon, and moved the ticket keys out
of the sentence into small `Tag`s underneath, so the placeholder reads like a
considered empty state instead of a dumped string. No scope or behavior
change — still the same two tabs, same reasoning, same tickets cited.

### Added — Personal Dashboard: a real top-level menu, isolated from the earlier build (MOVE-3412)

Judgment call from explicit feedback: *"pisahkan dengan personal dashboard
yang sudah kamu buat... jangan gabung komponent apapun ya... buatkan ini di
menu baru bernama personal dashboard."* The Customer-Notification-hidden
build below (`personaldashboard/PersonalDashboardLeaveTab.tsx`) is going to be
reworked separately, so this is a **second, independent implementation of the
same epic** — new folder `src/components/employeeportal/`, a real top-level
sidebar entry ("Personal Dashboard", its own `AppPage` route), and zero shared
UI components with either `personaldashboard/PersonalDashboardLeaveTab.tsx` or
`leave/LeaveApplicationDrawers.tsx`. The two builds now sit side by side; the
older one is left completely untouched.

**What is, and isn't, "a component" for this isolation rule.** Every piece of
UI — `EmployeePortalPage.tsx` (Home/Leave/Claims/Pay Slip tabs),
`EmployeePortalLeaveTab.tsx` (the three tables), `EmployeePortalLeaveDrawers.tsx`
(Apply Leave, the details drawer, the confirm modals) — is written fresh, on
purpose using different AntD idioms than the earlier build (`Form.useWatch`
instead of manual state, `Descriptions` instead of a hand-rolled read-row,
`Segmented` for the year toggle) so nothing is a copy-paste with the serial
numbers filed off. What *is* still shared is `leave/leaveData.ts` and
`leave/leaveLogic.ts` — the mock database and the carry-forward/pro-ration/
deduction rules, no UI in either file. Recomputing those a second time was
judged the wrong kind of independence: it would risk this page's balances
disagreeing with the HR module's over the exact same employee, for no benefit
to the user's actual ask.

**Same scope as before, rebuilt clean**: MOVE-3946 (Apply), MOVE-3950
(Cancel), MOVE-3952 (Approve/Reject + "Pending My Approval"), MOVE-3956
(auto-approve when no leave approver), MOVE-3965 (details drawer), MOVE-3947
(applications table + its Leave Type/Status filters), MOVE-3948 (balances
table with the Remaining column and the this-year/next-year `Segmented`
toggle). Claims and Pay Slip stay honest "not specified" placeholders
(MOVE-3776/3943/3945/3958/3964 are a separate domain; MOVE-3953/3954/3949 have
empty descriptions) — same reasoning as the earlier build, restated here
because this is a from-scratch page, not an edit to it. "Me" is again Citra
Dewi (lv-3), for the same reason: real seed data on both sides of the tab
(own applications *and* 5 applications pending her approval) without
engineering new mock data.

**Two bugs caught in live verification, fixed before shipping:**
- The details drawer showed "Cancel Leave" even when opened from "Pending My
  Approval" — i.e. an approver could cancel *someone else's* application,
  which contradicts MOVE-3947 biz req 4's explicit "manage own dashboard
  means only your own leave" rule. Cancel now only shows when the drawer was
  opened from the viewer's own Applications table, never from the approval
  queue.
- Approving/rejecting/cancelling mutated `LEAVE_APPLICATIONS` in place, but
  the three tables were memoized on inputs that never changed (`self`,
  `year`, `filters`), so nothing re-rendered until an unrelated prop changed.
  Added the `revision` bump counter as an explicit `useMemo` dependency on all
  three so a mutation is visible immediately — caught by watching "Pending My
  Approval" not lose a row after rejecting it.

**Verified live in Chromium**: Personal Dashboard is a real sidebar entry
(not behind Customer Notification); Home/Leave/Claims/Pay Slip tabs all
render; Apply for Leave's leave-type select and date range work; the
Annual Leave balance row shows "19 days (incl. 7 carried forward)", matching
Citra's 2025 usage; opening Krisna Wibisono's application from "Pending My
Approval" shows only Reject/Approve (no Cancel); rejecting with an empty
reason keeps Confirm disabled, filling it enables Confirm, and after
confirming his row drops out of the queue (5 → 4) without a page reload.
`npx tsc --noEmit` clean.

### Added — Personal Dashboard: the Leave tab (MOVE-3412), correcting the previous link

The earlier "build it in Customer Notification" request had cited MOVE-4075
(driver mobile app, epic MOVE-4113). The correct link was **MOVE-3412 "WLA: HR
- Personal Dashboard"** — a different, web epic: the self-service portal where
an employee views and manages their *own* leave, as opposed to MOVE-3494 where
HR views an employee's. Both builds are kept; the Customer Notification page
now carries a third pill, **Personal Dashboard (web)**, alongside Customer
Notifications and Driver Leave (mobile).

**Read all 22 of MOVE-3412's children before deciding scope.** They split
three ways:

- **Leave self-service** (7 real tickets) — built.
- **Claims self-service** (MOVE-3776, 3943, 3945, 3958, 3964 + 2 cancelled/KIV)
  — an entire separate domain (claim types, receipts, fleet-linked ERP/Carpark
  claims, its own approval flow) with no existing data model or business rules
  to build on. Not built.
- **Payslip and Dashboard Home** (MOVE-3949, 3953, 3954) — all three have an
  **empty description**. Nothing to build from.
- **Notification tickets** (MOVE-3959, 3960, 3961, 3962, 3963) are all
  `[KIV]`, and MOVE-3944/3951 (`[x]`) are cancelled duplicates of their
  listing tickets. None of these are built, by the tickets' own status.

**MOVE-3946 / MOVE-3950 / MOVE-3965 each say, explicitly, "same fields and
logic as the leave module."** So this is not a reimplementation: the Leave
tab's Apply for Leave button, its details drawer, and its cancel/approve/
reject actions are the *same* `ApplyLeaveDrawer` and `LeaveApplicationDrawer`
already built for MOVE-3777 / MOVE-3889 / MOVE-3779 / MOVE-3893, imported and
reused as-is. What is actually new is the self-service framing (which
employee is "me"), the Leave tab's own two tables (MOVE-3947, MOVE-3948 —
different columns and filters from the HR page), and the "Pending My
Approval" section (MOVE-3952) — the same drawer, opened against someone
else's application.

**"Me" is Citra Dewi (lv-3).** She already carries her own applications and
balances in the seed data, and — cross-checked against the dataset — she is
also the `leaveApprover` on five other employees with a currently pending
application. That is what makes "Pending My Approval" show real rows instead
of an empty state on the first render.

**Two gaps this closes on the shared HR drawer**, both flagged as open items
earlier in this session and both required by MOVE-3965 as well:

- **"Applied On/By" is relabelled "Created On/By."** MOVE-3889 and MOVE-3965
  both name it that; the underlying field is unchanged, since "created by" is
  there to cover HR applying on an employee's behalf, which is exactly what
  `appliedBy` already records.
- **The reject and cancel confirmations now collect a reason.** Per the 20 Sep
  revisions of MOVE-3893 and MOVE-3779: rejection's reason is **required**
  (the Confirm button stays disabled until it's filled), cancellation's is
  **optional**. Both cap at 120 characters with a counter. The drawer's
  Additional Information block shows "Reason for Rejection" / "Reason for
  Cancellation" only for that status, `-` when cancellation's is blank. This
  fixes the drawer for the HR module (MOVE-3889) at the same time as it
  satisfies MOVE-3965 — one component, one fix.

**Verified live in Chromium:** the Leave tab renders Citra's 5 own
applications, 10 balance rows (Remaining column, not Balance), and 5 rows
pending her approval; rejecting Joko Prasetyo's application from "Pending My
Approval" is blocked with the Confirm button disabled until a reason is typed,
then removes his row from the queue and shows the reason on the drawer,
correctly attributed to `CURRENT_USER`; on the HR side, the same drawer's
Cancel still confirms with an empty, optional reason. `npx tsc --noEmit`
clean.

**Open items for the PM**

- No sort order is specified anywhere for "Pending My Approval." Built
  oldest-applied-first, on the reasoning that an approval queue reads better
  that way; MOVE-3947's applications table keeps the newest-first default the
  ticket does specify.
- MOVE-3965's own spec is three bullet points ("view supporting document",
  "created by", "rejected + reason for rejection") rather than a field table —
  read as *additions* to MOVE-3889's existing table rather than its full
  replacement, which is what let the same drawer serve both tickets.
- Claims, Payslip and Dashboard Home remain unbuilt, per above. If any of
  these is wanted next, Claims needs a data model started roughly the way
  `leaveData.ts` was: types, entitlements, and a seed seeded through its own
  `deduction`-equivalent, since its business rules (auto-appended Bus
  Number/Route into Remarks, receipt-time-vs-now validation) are new and
  non-trivial.

### Added — Driver mobile app: Manage Leave (MOVE-2481, MOVE-4073, MOVE-4074, MOVE-4075)

The first screens from epic **MOVE-4113 (WL Mobile Apps: Driver – Accounts Tab)**.
Four screens in a 390×844 phone frame: Manage Leave, Apply Leave, View Leave
Application, and the Cancel Leave confirmation.

**It is parked behind a switch on the Customer Notification page.** The name
does not match, and that is deliberate — the driver app has no menu of its own
yet and is not meant to be found by accident, so the page still opens exactly
as it did and the prototype rides along behind a pill toggle.

**No leave rule is re-derived.** The driver tickets defer to the HR ones —
MOVE-2481 §2 cites MOVE-3494 biz req 2 for the balance table, and the expand
section cites MOVE-4137 biz req 1.2 — so the screens call `leaveLogic`
directly. That is what makes the numbers agree with the HR module by
construction rather than by luck: Joko Prasetyo's NS leave reads 11 days
because he is on 5.5+ working days a week and MOVE-3777 §3.2 charges a
consecutive Sat+Sun pair as one day.

**Built to the tickets:**

- **Manage Leave** — Apply for Leave CTA, one card per application (leave type,
  dates, time sub-text *only* for time off, Days Used with `-` for time off,
  applied-on, status), the exact empty-state copy "No leave applications yet.",
  balance cards sorted system-then-custom, and a year toggle limited to **this
  year and next year** with this year as the default, which is what §2 asks for
  rather than the HR page's open-ended year list.
- **Expand section only for the two annual leave types** — Carried Forward,
  Entitlement This Year, Total Entitlement This Year. Verified live: 2 + 7 = 9.
- **View Leave Application** — every status-dependent block appears only for its
  own status, including the two reason fields.
- **Cancel Leave** — enabled only for Pending Approval / Approved, greyed with
  an explanation otherwise; the modal quotes the ticket's copy verbatim; and
  **the balance releases because the status changed**, not because anything
  wrote a balance. `usageFor` only counts Approved and Pending Approval, so
  flipping the status is the whole mechanism. Verified live: cancelling Joko's
  pending 5-day application moved Pending Approval 5 → 0 and Balance 4 → 9.
- **Offline banner** — fixed, not a toast; disappears on reconnect; "You are
  back online" on return; navigation while offline is blocked with "Unable to
  access due to no internet connection". A control beside the phone toggles it.

**Data model.** `LeaveApplication` gained `rejectionReason` and
`cancellationReason`. MOVE-4073 §2 requires both, and the 20 Sep revisions of
MOVE-3893 and MOVE-3779 added the same two fields to the HR side. Two
applications were seeded for Joko Prasetyo — one Rejected, one Cancelled —
because MOVE-4075 §1's disabled states cannot be seen at all unless the signed-in
driver has an application in each status.

**Open items for the PM**

These three driver tickets carry a lot of text pasted from other tickets, which
is worth fixing before anyone builds against them:

- **MOVE-4074 §4** is a copy table about "unable to Update Password", and the
  Acceptance Criteria of both MOVE-4073 and MOVE-4074 describe changing a
  password and logging out. There is therefore **no specified toaster or error
  copy for Apply Leave**, and no stated result for a successful submit. Built to
  follow MOVE-3777 §4 instead: pending approval, or approved when the employee
  has no leave approver.
- **MOVE-4073 §2** says "Show field only if **claim** status = cancelled /
  rejected" for the two reason fields — *claim*, not *leave*, pasted from the
  Claims module.
- **MOVE-4073 §4** gives the Cancel action's access permissions as "Master &
  Junior System Admin / any tenant staff with permission to cancel any leave",
  which is the HR ticket's answer. MOVE-4075 §1 says the opposite: this is the
  driver's own app, own-tenant drivers only, and subcon drivers have no access
  to leave at all.
- **MOVE-4075's Acceptance Criteria** describe the View Leave Application page
  rather than cancelling, and refer to a "biz req #4" that the ticket does not
  have.
- **MOVE-2481 §2** places "1 card = 1 leave type" between the application-card
  table and the balance section, so it is ambiguous which it governs. Read as
  the balance cards, since applications are already one card each.
- Sort order for the application cards is unspecified; used applied-on newest
  first, matching MOVE-3494 §3.
- The two new reason fields are **not yet shown in the HR-side leave application
  drawer**, which the 20 Sep MOVE-3893/3779 edits also require. MOVE-3889's own
  field table still does not list them.

### Added — `tools/jira-desc-diff.py`, and a nightly Jira watch built on it

The Leave tickets have been edited on four separate days in the last week, and
each check so far has meant re-deriving the same thing by hand. A scheduled
Routine now does it: every night at 23:00 SGT a fresh session diffs the Leave
epic's tickets against what the repo has already applied, and applies whatever
it finds. It is read-only against Jira — it never edits, comments on, or
transitions a ticket.

The script is the part worth keeping in the repo. Most Leave ticket edits are
Jira reflowing its own markup — a wiki table becoming an embedded ADF one,
column widths moving — and a raw description diff drowns a one-word rule change
in hundreds of lines of that. `jira-desc-diff.py` normalises both sides to
table *cells* first, so a formatting-only edit prints "(formatting only)" and a
real edit prints exactly the sentence that moved. It had been living in a
session scratchpad, which is precisely where a Routine cannot reach it.

**The watermark is `WhatsNew.tsx`, not the Routine.** The latest `on:` date in
`LEAVE_CHANGES` is the last ticket edit that has been applied, and that is what
a run diffs from — so a missed night self-corrects on the next run instead of
leaving a hole. The change registry built for the reader turns out to be the
right state for the scheduler too.

### Changed — Leave: the 18 Sep ticket revisions, one day after the last batch

Six Leave tickets were touched again on 18 Sep 2026. Four were wording only
(MOVE-3500, MOVE-3777, MOVE-3778, and MOVE-3494's action table gaining an
explicit "click a balance row → MOVE-4137" line, which was already built). Two
changed behaviour.

**MOVE-3775 — Edit Leave Entitlement leaves the balances table entirely.** The
ticket's entry point was rewritten from "in actions column of leave balances
table" to "on the employee's leave balance details drawer → access 'edit'
action (primary CTA)". So:

- **The Actions column is removed from Leave Balances.** Yesterday's entry
  recorded keeping the pencil icon *and* adding the row click as a judgment
  call, on the grounds that MOVE-3775 still asked for the column. It no longer
  does, so the column goes. That is the ticket overruling the call, which is
  the outcome the call was made to allow.
- **Saving an edit returns to the drawer**, per biz req 2's "remain on
  employee's leave balance details drawer". The modal now opens above the
  drawer (`zIndex` 1100) instead of replacing it, and the drawer is keyed by
  leave type id rather than holding a captured `BalanceRow` — so it re-reads
  its figures after the save rather than showing what it captured on open.
  Verified live: editing Andi Nugroho's annual leave from 12 to 20 days moves
  the open drawer to 20 days and its total to 27 without closing.

**MOVE-4137 — the usage list is now an explicit either/or.** Biz req 1.3 gained
an **Option 1** (by month, what was built yesterday) and an **Option 2** (by
application), with the note *"Show EITHER option 1 OR option 2 → depending on
dev effort"*. Both are built and labelled as such in the drawer, so the choice
can be made by looking at them rather than by imagining them.

- **Option 2 now matches its spec.** An application's dates are shown unclipped,
  and a cross-year application lists its days **per year** — Andi Nugroho's
  24 Dec 2026 – 5 Jan 2027 reads "5 days (2026) / 2 days (2027)", identically
  whether 2026 or 2027 is being viewed. It previously showed only the viewing
  year's share.
- **Remarks and Supporting Document are gone from the drawer.** The 18 Sep edit
  trimmed the summary table to Entitlement / Used / Pending Approval / Balance —
  "same as what is shown on employee leave profile details page" — and dropped
  those three rows. This closes yesterday's open item about where they belonged:
  the answer is that they do not. Both still read on the leave application
  details drawer (MOVE-3889), which is where an application's own fields live.
  The status tag is kept on each Option 2 row as a judgment call — a list of
  applications with no status would show days for a rejected row that never
  left the balance.
- **"Entitlement This Year" must reflect a per-employee edit**, not the leave
  type default. It already did, since the MOVE-3775 override flows through
  `balanceRowFor` before the breakdown is taken; the live check above confirms
  it.

The in-app change layer picks up three more entries and now covers 10 – 18 Sep.

### Added — Leave: a "what changed" layer over the module, and the 14–17 Sep ticket revisions

Six Leave tickets were edited on 17 Sep 2026 and a seventh was created that
morning. Rather than ship the changes and leave the reader to re-explore eleven
screens looking for them, every applied change is registered once in a new
`WhatsNew.tsx` and then **pinned to the control it actually affected**.

- A violet banner on all three Leave pages states the count and the window, and
  opens a drawer listing every change grouped by screen, with the old behaviour
  where it differed and a link to the ticket.
- Inline `NEW` / `UPDATED` badges sit on the affected column headers, section
  titles and CTAs. Hovering one gives the rule, what it replaced, and the
  ticket reference.
- A switch on the banner hides every badge, so the shipping view is one click
  away. The choice persists in `localStorage`.

This is prototype scaffolding, deliberately: registering a change and marking it
are the same act, so an entry with no badge anywhere is a change nobody can
find, and a badge with no entry does not compile.

### Added — Leave Balance Details drawer (MOVE-4137)

A brand-new ticket, created 17 Sep 2026 10:00. Clicking a row in the leave
balances table opens a drawer with the balance for the viewing year, the
month-by-month usage behind it, the applications that produced it, and the
audit trail.

- **Days used by month** walks each approved application day by day through the
  deduction rule rather than attributing the whole application to its start
  month, which is what the ticket's own 30 Mar – 3 Apr example requires (2 days
  in March, 3 in April). Half-day markers therefore land in the month that
  holds them. Verified live: Bella's maternity leave reads Sep 18 / Oct 22 /
  Nov 21 / Dec 18, summing to the 79 days her balance row shows.
- **The entitlement breakdown section renders only for annual leave and annual
  leave (drivers)**, per biz req 1.2. Ahmad Fauzi reads 7 carried forward + 12
  this year = 19 total.
- **Added On / Added By** needed data that did not exist, so
  `EmployeeEntitlement` gained an `addedOn`/`addedBy` pair and
  `EntitlementOverride` an `updatedOn`/`updatedBy` pair. An auto-added
  entitlement was never added by anyone, so it reads `System` with the validity
  effective date, which is the ticket's "display 'system'" case.

**A judgment call.** The ticket's first table mixes four balance labels
(Entitlement, Used, Pending Approval, Balance) with three that belong to a
single leave application (Days Used, Remarks, Supporting Document). One drawer
cannot show three per-application fields as drawer-level rows when there are
five applications, so the first four are the balance summary and the last three
read on each row of the applications list. Flagged in Open items rather than
guessed silently.

### Changed — Leave rules rewritten against the 17 Sep MOVE-3900 revision

- **Carry-forward is no longer a flat 7 days.** MOVE-3900 §1.2 now sets the cap
  at the leave type's *own default entitlement* — 12 for Annual Leave — and
  §2.2 doubles it for Annual Leave (Drivers), so 14. The ticket is explicit that
  editing the default entitlement has to move the cap with it, so this is stored
  as a `carryForwardMultiplier` on the type and read through `maxCarryForward`
  rather than baked into a constant. `MAX_CARRY_FORWARD` is gone. Visible in the
  data: Farhan Hakim now carries 12 days into 2026 where he was capped at 7.
- **Pro-ration counts completed months.** The ticket replaced "by months, round
  up" with "no. of completed months of service", and moved its rounding rule
  down to the resulting day count (`< 0.5` down, `≥ 0.5` up — which is what
  `Math.round` already did). A 20 Jul start is now 5 completed months → 5 days,
  where it was 6. Verified live: Laras Puspita (2 Feb 2026 start) reads 10 days,
  previously 11.
- **The ticket's self-contradictory third example is gone**, deleted by the PM
  in the same edit. The note flagging it is removed with it, and the
  corresponding Open item is closed.
- **Birthday leave** was rewritten into three explicit branches for the first
  year of service. The existing implementation already satisfies all three —
  only the comment changed, to cite the new wording.
- **Annual leave is non-drivers only** and Annual Leave (Drivers) now carries a
  full spec table of its own instead of "same as annual leave, except". Both
  already matched the dataset; no behaviour change.

### Changed — Leave profile, against the 17 Sep MOVE-3494 revision

- **The page-level Actions dropdown is removed.** MOVE-3494 biz req 4 struck out
  both of its entries; Edit Leave Entitlement and Leave Entitlement Change
  History now open from the balance details drawer. This closes the open
  question from 11 Sep about a page-level "Edit Leave Entitlement" having no row
  context — the ticket resolved it by deleting the action.
- **Validity Period always shows a date range.** The clause that had system
  types showing the manage-page wording is gone, which also closes the second
  open question: the ticket's childcare example wins. Manually added
  entitlements use the dates entered when they were added.
- **Balances default sort corrected** to system leave types in the manage-page
  order, then custom types by effective date newest first. The previous reading
  sorted auto-added before manually added, each alphabetically — a different
  split, since maternity leave is a system type that only ever arrives manually.
- **Leave applications table is paginated at 10**, per biz req 3.
- **Apply Leave is a secondary CTA** and encashment stays a dropdown. Both were
  queued as 10 Sep deltas, and both were reversed by later ticket edits before
  being applied — noted here because "we checked and the answer moved back" is
  worth as much as a change.

**Open items for the PM**

- MOVE-4137 biz req 1.1 lists Days Used, Remarks and Supporting Document as
  drawer-level rows alongside the balance summary, but all three are properties
  of one leave application. Built as per-application rows; confirm.
  *(Resolved 18 Sep 2026: the PM removed all three from the drawer. See the
  Unreleased entry above.)*
- MOVE-3777 biz req 3.1 says a leave type whose validity period has fully passed
  displays "Available: 0 days". The drawer currently shows the real balance with
  "Validity period has passed" beside it, which is more informative but off
  spec. Left alone as it predates this batch.
- Carry-forward on top of a pro-rated final year is still unspecified (see the
  older entry below).

### Changed — a much larger Leave dataset, and seed data that computes its own day counts

**The structural part first, because it is the reason the rest can be trusted.**
`deductionFor` moved into a new `leaveDeduction.ts` that sits below both
`leaveData` and `leaveLogic` and takes `workingDaysPerWeek` rather than an
employee. That breaks the import cycle, which lets **every seed application
compute its own `days` through the same function the apply drawer uses**. The
counts were hand-typed before and were free to drift from the rule — the kind
of mock data that quietly makes a prototype lie about its own arithmetic. A
wrong number is now not expressible.

**Dataset, roughly tripled:**

| | Was | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employees (listed / total) | 19 / 22 | **33 / 37** |
| Leave applications | 10 | **70** |
| Custom leave types | 0 | **3** |
| Manually added entitlements | 2 | **10** |
| Entitlement change history | 2 | **14** |
| Entitlement overrides | 0 | **2** |

**Carry-forward now varies, which was the point.** Every profile previously
showed the full 7 days carried in, because no employee had any 2025 usage — the
rule looked like a constant. With a year of prior applications seeded, page one
of the listing alone now runs Joko 4, Bella 9, Dedi 12, Farhan 14, Gita 17,
Citra 19.

**Coverage the old set had none of:**

- **Three custom leave types**, chosen to exercise MOVE-3559's four-way edit
  rule: Volunteer Leave is still in the future, Study Leave is running, and
  Marriage Leave ended in 2025 so its entitlement is locked.
- **A cross-year application** (Andi Nugroho, 24 Dec 2026 – 5 Jan 2027) —
  MOVE-3494's own worked example, now visible in the seed rather than only
  reachable by typing it in.
- **Two entitlement overrides with matching history rows**, one applied forward
  and one for a single year, so both settings of MOVE-3775's checkbox are
  represented and the history agrees with the balances table.
- Four **Edit** rows in the change history across three users, so MOVE-3888's
  Edit Type / User / Field Edited filters finally have something to filter.
- Retired added to the excluded statuses, alongside Terminated, Resigned and
  Future Employee.
- Every leave type is now exercised by at least one application, including NS,
  Compassionate, Unpaid, Shared Parental, Adoption, Unpaid Infant Care and both
  Time Off entries with real times.

**One clarity fix the new data forced.** The applications table's Days Used
column shows the application's own deduction, so a cross-year row reads "7 days"
in both years — which contradicts the balances table beside it, counting 5 in
2026 and 2 in 2027. When the two differ the row now names the year's share
underneath ("5 days in 2026"). The headline figure still follows MOVE-3494 biz
req 3 literally.

### Fixed — Leave module CTA audit against the tickets

Every button in the module walked back to the line of the ticket that specifies
it. Three were wrong; the rest were confirmed rather than assumed.

**1. The profile page had the wrong primary CTA.** MOVE-3500 biz req 1 is
explicit — "On the employee's leave profile details page → **primary CTA** 'add
leave entitlement'". Apply Leave was carrying the primary styling. Swapped.
Noted in the code that Apply Leave is the busier action of the two, so this is
the ticket's call rather than an ergonomic one; **PM may want to revisit it.**

**2. The leave balances table had no Actions column.** MOVE-3775 biz req 1
reaches Edit Leave Entitlement "in actions column of leave balances table (see
3494, biz req 2, row 7)". It was an unlabelled column of bare icons, which does
not read as one. Now titled **Actions**, with a per-row tooltip naming the leave
type it edits.

**3. Disabled actions gave no reason.** MOVE-3779 biz req 1 and MOVE-3893 biz
req 1 both say the action is disabled **with a tooltip** when the status
forbids it. The items were greyed and silent. Each now explains itself — "Only
a pending application can be approved — this one is approved." AntD does not
fire hover events on a disabled menu item, so the tooltip wraps the label
rather than the item.

**Confirmed correct, driven in the browser rather than read off the source** —
18 checks, all passing:

| Ticket | Check |
| --- | --- |
| MOVE-1975 §4 | Manage Leave Types is the primary CTA; a row opens the profile |
| MOVE-1977 §3 | Create Leave Type is primary; Return to listing present; a row in **either** table opens the details drawer |
| MOVE-4019 §2 | Edit is the drawer's primary CTA, on system types too |
| MOVE-3559 §2 | header "Edit [leave type name]", Save primary / Cancel secondary |
| MOVE-3221 §2/§4 | header "Create Leave Type", Save primary, and Cancel creates nothing |
| MOVE-3500 §2 | header "Add Leave Entitlement", Save primary / Cancel secondary |
| MOVE-3775 §2 | header "Edit [leave type]", Save primary / Cancel secondary |
| MOVE-3777 §2 | header "Apply for Leave", Send for Approval primary |
| MOVE-3888 §1 | change history sits under the actions dropdown |
| MOVE-3889 §2 | **no primary CTA** on the details drawer — actions live in a dropdown |
| MOVE-3893 | a **rejected** application offers nothing: approve, reject *and* cancel are all disabled |

### Fixed — three bugs in the Leave module, found on a re-check of the listing

Raised by the reviewer looking at the listing and saying the numbers looked
off. They were. All three had survived the first round of verification because
that round only exercised full-year employees and single-year applications.

**1. Annual leave pro-ration was a month too generous.** `monthsOfServiceIn`
carried a stray `+1`, so every partial year came out one month high. It was
invisible on full-time staff because `Math.min(12, …)` clipped the overflow —
which is exactly why it got through. Checked against MOVE-3900 §1's own
examples:

| Case | Ticket | Was | Now |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Contract starts 1 Jul 2026 | 6 days | 7 | **6** |
| Contract starts 20 Jul 2026 | 6 days | 7 | **6** |
| Full calendar year | 12 days | 12 | **12** |

On screen: Hendra Saputra and Indah Lestari (both starting 1 Jun 2026) went
from 8 days to **7**, and Toni Wibowo from 13 to 12.

**Ticket error worth flagging:** MOVE-3900 §1's *third* example says a contract
ending 20 May 2026 is "5 months & 20 days → round up to 6". From 1 Jan that is
4 months and 20 days, not 5 — so the stated conclusion does not follow from its
own premise. The two internally consistent examples win; this returns 5 and the
discrepancy is noted in the code. **PM should confirm which they meant.**
*(Resolved 17 Sep 2026: the PM deleted that example in the same edit that
switched pro-ration to completed months. See the Unreleased entry above.)*

**2. A leave application spanning two years split its days by calendar length.**
`daysInYear` pro-rated `app.days` by the share of dates in each year, which
disagrees with the deduction rules whenever the split lands near a weekend or a
public holiday — and MOVE-3494's own worked example is precisely such a case.
Each year's slice is now re-run through `deductionFor`, with the half-day
markers assigned to whichever slice actually holds that end.

**3. The apply drawer would not accept a cross-year application at all.**
MOVE-3777 biz req 2 disables dates outside the validity period, while biz req 3
walks through applying 24 Dec 2026 – 5 Jan 2027 against annual leave that ends
31 Dec 2026. Read literally the two contradict; the resolution is that a
recurring type has a *separate* window each year and the application spans two
of them. `isSelectableDate()` now checks the viewing year's window **and** the
next one when the type auto-recurs.

That unblocked the other half of biz req 3, which was missing: **the drawer now
shows one balance block per year** when the period crosses a boundary. Verified
against the ticket's example on Ahmad Fauzi — 2026 available 15.5, deduction 5,
balance 10.5; 2027 available 19, deduction 2, balance 17 — and after submitting,
2026's pending rose by 5 and 2027's by 2, exactly as MOVE-3494 describes.

**Not a bug, worth knowing:** carry-forward into 2027 then reads 3.5 rather than
7, because it is computed from 2026's entitlement *excluding* what 2026 itself
carried in. That is deliberate — letting it compound would inflate the
entitlement a little more every year.

### Added — the rest of the Leave module (epic MOVE-3410)

All 15 live child tickets of the epic. **MOVE-3778 ([x] Edit Leave) is
cancelled** and was not built — the `[x]` prefix is the same convention that
marked MOVE-3658 dead earlier in this project.

| Ticket | Built |
| --- | --- |
| MOVE-3900 | 15 pre-created system leave types, with their validity models |
| MOVE-3890 | auto-created profile — which types an employee sees, and when |
| MOVE-1977 | Manage Leave Types page (custom + system tables) |
| MOVE-4019 | leave type details drawer |
| MOVE-3221 | create leave type drawer |
| MOVE-3559 | edit leave type drawer |
| MOVE-3494 | employee leave profile, by year |
| MOVE-3500 | add leave entitlement modal |
| MOVE-3775 | edit leave entitlement modal |
| MOVE-3888 | entitlement change history drawer |
| MOVE-3777 | apply leave drawer |
| MOVE-3889 | leave application details drawer |
| MOVE-3779 | cancel leave |
| MOVE-3893 | approve / reject leave |

**`leaveLogic.ts` is the single source for every rule**, the same way
`rosterStatusLogic` is for the roster. The balances table, the apply drawer's
live preview, both entitlement modals and the listing's AL/ML columns all
compute from it — they can only agree because they share it.

**Worked examples from the tickets, verified live rather than asserted:**

- **Driver vs non-driver annual leave** — Eka Wijaya (Driver) gets *Annual Leave
  (Drivers)* at 7 days; Ahmad Fauzi gets *Annual Leave* at 12. The listing's
  "AL Balance" column picks whichever type the employee is actually on.
- **MOVE-3900 §5 birthday leave**, the epic's fiddliest rule: Indah Lestari
  (born June, started 1 Jun 2026) has **no** birthday leave in 2026 — she
  completes three months on 1 Sep, after her birth month — and gets it in 2027.
  That is the ticket's first worked example, alive in the data.
- **MOVE-3494 childcare recurrence** — Citra Dewi's childcare leave shows for
  2026 (1 Apr – 31 Dec), 2027 and 2028 as full calendar years, and 2029 is not
  even offered in the year toggle.
- **MOVE-3777 §3.2 deduction** — Dedi Kurniawan works 5.5 days a week, so his
  31 Jul – 8 Aug application costs **6 days**: five weekdays plus one for the
  consecutive Sat–Sun at the start, and nothing for the lone Saturday at the
  end. The ticket's own example, matched exactly.
- **Weeks → days** — Nadia Rahmawati's adoption leave reads "12 weeks / 60 days"
  at her 5 working days per week.
- **The full application lifecycle**: applying moved 3 days into pending and
  balance 15.5 → 12.5; approving moved them pending → used with balance
  unchanged; cancelling released them and returned every number to its start.

**Judgment calls worth knowing:**

- **Balance is derived everywhere, never stored.** Cancelling a leave needs no
  balance adjustment because nothing was ever written down — `balancesFor()`
  recomputes from application status. Same for carry-forward and pro-ration.
- **Carry-forward does not compound.** MOVE-3900 says up to 7 days roll into the
  next year; computing the previous year's balance *without* its own
  carry-forward stops that recursing into an ever-growing entitlement. Every
  employee currently shows 7 carried days because the mock data has no 2025
  applications — that is the rule working, not a seeded number.
- **A negative balance on apply is allowed, not blocked.** MOVE-3777 §3 says the
  excess becomes unpaid leave, so the drawer says exactly that instead of
  refusing the submit. The entitlement editor is the opposite: MOVE-3775 §3
  requires a hard block, and it blocks with the arithmetic shown live.
- **MOVE-3559's four-way edit rule** (system vs custom, effective passed, end
  passed) is computed once in `editableFields()` rather than repeated as
  `disabled` expressions across six controls.
- **Uploads record a file name only.** There is no backend, so the details
  drawer says so on hover rather than offering a download that cannot work.
- **`PaginationBar` was extracted** to `leave/PaginationBar.tsx` and is shared
  by the leave pages. Invoice 2.0 still has its own copy — collapsing that too
  was outside this ticket's scope.

**Open items for the PM**

- MOVE-3900 does not say whether carry-forward should apply on top of a
  *pro-rated* final year. It currently does — Toni Wibowo's 2026 reads 6
  pro-rated + 7 carried = 13. Flagged rather than guessed.
- Encashment is captured and displayed but has no effect, as MOVE-3559 §3 says
  for MVP 1.
- The copy master list linked throughout the epic is a Lark doc that is not
  reachable from here, so toaster and tooltip wording is written to match the
  described intent rather than quoted.

### Added — Leave module: listing page (MOVE-1975)

A new top-level **Leave** menu entry and its listing, one row per employee.
Built on the listing chrome the app already uses (Invoice 2.0 / the Inspection
reference): right-aligned toolbar, Filter popover behind the funnel, detached
pagination card. No new patterns — the point is that Leave looks like every
other listing.

**Against the ticket, verified live:**

- **Columns** — Employee, Hiring Company, Department, AL Balance, ML Balance,
  Last Updated On (biz req 1).
- **Active contracts only.** The dataset holds 22 employees; 19 reach the table.
  A Terminated, a Resigned and a Future Employee are in there deliberately so
  the rule is visible in the count rather than taken on trust.
- **Hiring Company shows the most recent contract, the rest as `+n`** — Bella
  Santoso renders `Westpoint Coach +2`, with the hidden ones on hover so
  nothing is actually lost.
- **Default sort is Last Updated On, newest first** (biz req 2), confirmed by
  reading the rendered column: 26 → 14 Aug descending.
- **Sorting matches the acceptance criteria exactly**: Employee, Hiring Company,
  Department and Last Updated On carry sorters; **AL and ML Balance do not.**
  Measured from the rendered headers, since that distinction is easy to get
  wrong and invisible in a screenshot.
- **Search** is a full-text match on Employee alone, placeholder "Search
  Employees" — "bella" narrows 19 → 1.
- **Filters** — Hiring Company (multi-select), Department (multi-select with
  auto-complete, "Not applicable" included as a real option), Last Updated On
  range, plus Clear all filters. Department = Human Resources gives 2.

**Judgment calls worth knowing:**

- **Balance is derived, not stored.** MOVE-3494 biz req 2 row 6 defines it as
  `entitlement − used − pending approval`, with a null entitlement rendering as
  `-` regardless of what has been taken. Modelling it that way means the listing
  cannot drift from the profile page when that ticket gets built; Eka Wijaya has
  no ML entitlement so the dash is exercised.
- **The "x days ago" sub-text is computed** from the timestamp rather than
  stored as a second string the way other listings do it — those two can drift,
  and here they cannot.
- **The Last Updated On range picker sits in the toolbar**, not the popover, as
  the reference layout places it. It also appears in the popover so both routes
  work off the same state.
- **Leave is top-level, not under Operations.** The listing is HR's and spans
  every department, so nesting it under Operations would have implied a scope
  it does not have.
- **Two linked destinations are stubs.** "Manage Leave Types" (MOVE-1977) and
  the row click through to the Employee Leave Profile (MOVE-3494) are separate
  tickets; both are wired and say plainly that they are not built rather than
  opening an empty page.

### Changed — Live Tracking 2.0 opens on the reviewed Display settings

The panel's settings were signed off in the 28 Aug review, so they are the
page's starting values now rather than eleven controls to set by hand each time
the demo is opened. Every one stays switchable; only the default moved.

Eleven changed, and all 25 rows were read back from the live panel to confirm
they match the reviewed screenshot:

| Setting | Was | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List : map size | 60 : 40 | **65 : 35** |
| Slack format | Minutes (130min) | **Hours + min (2hr 10min)** |
| Show delay text | on | **off** |
| Driver status text | on | **off** |
| L2 spacing | 12px | **24px** |
| Flashing | Ring | **Glow** |
| L2 font | 11px | **12px** |
| Box padding | 10px | **14px** |
| Show route | on | **off** |
| Show traffic | on | **off** |
| Use dummy data | off | **on** |

The other fourteen already matched: Silver map, Rev 03 card, 9. Panel highlight,
Bus markers, Default map card, map on the Left, Drawer detail panel, action On
card, Claim workflow, Text claim button, All cards (v1), Category colour,
Compact width, Row slack position, Dropdown sort, L2 match L1 width off, L1
font 24px.

**Worth knowing: `Use dummy data` now defaults on**, which swaps the dataset the
page builds its stops from — the demo opens on `DUMMY_STOPS` rather than
`DEMO_TRIPS`. That is what the reviewed panel showed, so it is what shipped, but
it is the one default here that changes the data rather than the presentation.

### Added — three more shift-picker styles (Variant 4 now has five)

Asked for on the 28 Aug review. Rather than five shades of the same idea, the
five differ along three separate axes: what the selection is coloured with,
how heavy the frame around it is, and whether it is a set of buttons at all.

- **Shift colours** *(new)* — the selected shift wears the swatch the calendar
  already gives it: AM lilac, PM blue-grey, NA grey. The drawer and the month
  grid then agree on what AM looks like, and blue is left to Standby alone,
  which is the coverage decision the eye should find first. Verified live: the
  selected AM renders `#a5a0f5`, the same value as `DAY_GROUP_STYLE.AM`.
- **Pill group** *(new)* — one rounded frame around all three options with
  hairlines between them, instead of three separate boxes. The lightest of the
  button styles; the group owns the radius and clips the fill.
- **Dropdown** *(new)* — a compact Select. Measured at **92px against 140px**
  for the button row, and the only option that would still fit if the shift
  list ever grew past three. It costs a second click per change, which is the
  wrong trade when setting eleven rows in a row — it earns its place on width,
  not on speed, and the switcher hint says so.
- **Strong** and **Subtle** are unchanged. Strong stays the default.

**Tidied while here:** `ShiftContrast` was declared twice — once in
`ShiftSelector.tsx` and once in `RosterVariantSwitcher.tsx`. The two copies had
already drifted. There is now one definition, held with the rest of the variant
types, and `ShiftSelector` imports it.

### Added — Variants 10 and 11: the view drawer stops pretending to be a form

Two options asked for on the 28 Aug review of the View Roster drawer. Both
default to the new reading; the previous behaviour stays selectable so the two
can be compared.

**Variant 10 · Viewing a day — `Plain values` (default) / `Disabled controls`.**
The read-only drawer was drawing the *edit* controls with everything greyed out:
eleven rows of dead AM/NA buttons and empty checkboxes, which made View look
like a broken Edit and gave the eye nothing to skip. Viewing now renders values:
the shift as a coloured tag in the calendar's own swatches, and each modifier as
its name when on or an em-dash when off. Measured live — the view drawer went
from **33 checkboxes to 0**, while Edit is untouched at 33.

- Sub-text is kept, not dropped: "Standby from Rule", a standby reason, and the
  extension's `4h · reason` still read under their column.
- The two modes are now told apart at a glance, which the flow needs more than
  it used to: since MOVE-3967 a cell click lands on View, so that is the screen
  ops sees first and most often.

**Variant 11 · Day summary — `Count chips` (default) / `Off`.**
The drawer opened on nothing but "11 Employees", so the shape of a day had to be
counted off the rows. A chip row now restates the same numbers the calendar bar
already carries, in the place the detail is actually read.

- **Standby always shows, red at zero**, reusing `EMPTY_STANDBY_STYLE` — a day
  with no cover is the one number worth seeing even when it is nothing, exactly
  as the calendar draws its empty-standby bar.
- Extended and Absent appear only once there is one. A row of zeroes is the
  noise this summary exists to remove.
- Absent, suspended and On Leave staff are excluded from the standby and extend
  counts, matching the rule the calendar bars already use, so the drawer and the
  grid cannot disagree.
- Shown in both modes — the counts are as useful while editing as while reading.

### Changed — day cells react to hover, switcher rebuilt on the Live Tracking 2.0 panel, Roster 3.0 off the menu

Three items from the 27 Aug review.

**Day cells now answer a hover.** The cell became the click target when the
Edit Roster button went away, and nothing said so. Hovering an in-month cell
tints it (`#f0f7ff`, or a deeper `#bae0ff` on today, which is already blue) and
draws a 1px inset border. Out-of-month cells do not react — they open nothing.
The cell lifts to `z-index: 1` on hover so its highlight is not clipped by the
neighbour overlapping it by 1px.

**The hover wording is a new Variant 9 · Cell hover text**, with three settings
rather than two. The review asked for "Click to edit", but a cell click opens
the day **read-only** first (MOVE-3967) and Edit sits inside the drawer,
disabled on a past month — so "Click to edit" over-promises there. Rather than
silently overrule the request or ship copy that lies on past months, both are on
the switcher: **Off**, **Click to view** (default, matches the built flow), and
**Click to edit** (as asked). Pick one and it becomes the only one. The label
sits on the date row rather than below it, so showing it costs no height and the
bars underneath never shift.

**The switcher now wears Live Tracking 2.0's chrome**, as requested — the same
amber "Display settings" panel: 260px wide, amber header and drag handle, one
compact label-plus-control row per option, hairline dividers between groups, and
a circular amber reopener. Eight Segmented stacks became eight small Selects,
which is most of why the panel got shorter.

- **Judgment call worth knowing:** that layout has no room for the line of prose
  under each option, and the explanations were what made the panel demoable to
  PM. They moved onto the label as a tooltip rather than being deleted.
- The panel's dropdowns render at `z-index: 2100`; the panel itself sits at 900,
  below AntD's drawer layer, and its menus would otherwise open behind the
  calendar.

**Roster 3.0 is out of the sidebar** so it cannot be mistaken for the live
design. Per CLAUDE.md, Roster 4.0 is the variant that matches the PRD; 3.0 stays
in the code and on its route as a prior exploration, just not somewhere a
reviewer can wander into by accident.

### Fixed — Extend is now locked on public holidays (MOVE-3769 §3)

Found while re-checking the ticket over whether the edit drawer allows more than
one checkbox per row. It does — but the public-holiday table in MOVE-3769 §3
lists **Extend: Disable**, and only Shift was being disabled. There is no shift
to extend when every employee defaults to N.A., so Extend is now guarded by
`dayHoliday` alongside Shift. Standby and Absent stay enabled on a PH, which is
what the same table asks for.

The banner copy followed: it used to promise only that "standby can still be
assigned", which understated what is locked and what is not.

**On the multi-check question itself — the ticket is explicit, and the build
already matches it:**

- MOVE-3769 §2.1 says standby "is independent of (does not affect) AM/PM shift
  assignment", extension "is independent of (does not affect) AM/PM/standby
  assignment". So Standby + Extend together on one row is correct, not a bug.
- **Absent is the exception.** It is worded as independent too — ticking it does
  not clear the values already set — but the same row adds "Disable all fields
  in employee's row". Verified live: after ticking Absent, Shift, Standby and
  Extend all go read-only with their values and sub-text intact, and Absent
  itself stays clickable so the row can be released again. The spec says
  "all fields", which taken literally would trap the user; treating Absent as
  the one field that stays live is the reading that makes the "If uncheck →
  enable all fields" sentence work.
- Suspended rows disable everything including Absent, per §2.1 row 2.

### Added — Variant 8 · Design system, an on/off switch for the Figma tokens

Requested so the two can be compared before committing to one: the switcher's
new **Variant 8** runs the whole Roster 4.0 page on the team's Figma design
tokens, or leaves it on AntD's defaults. Three settings — **Off**, **Figma
tokens**, **Figma compact**. Off is the default, so nothing moves unless someone
asks for it.

- **`figmaTokens.ts` is generated, not hand-written.** Every value is resolved
  from the Tokens Studio export (`variables_1.json`), aliases included
  (`{Colors.Base.Blue.6}` and friends). Re-export from Figma and regenerate
  rather than editing it. Two objects: `FIGMA_TOKENS_DEFAULT`
  (colors-light + dimensions-default + typography-default) and
  `FIGMA_TOKENS_COMPACT` (the same colours on the compact scale).
- **The honest finding: the export is a stock Ant Design 5 palette.**
  `colorPrimary #1677ff`, `colorSuccess #52c41a`, `colorError #ff4d4f`,
  `colorBorder #d9d9d9`, `borderRadius 6`, `fontSize 14` — all identical to what
  the prototype already renders. So **Figma tokens** differs from **Off**
  essentially only in the typeface. **Figma compact** is the real comparison:
  measured live, buttons go 32px → 28px and body type 14px → 12px.
- **`fontFamily` got a fallback stack.** The export names `SF Pro Text` alone,
  which exists only on macOS; on anything else the browser would have dropped to
  its default serif and made the comparison meaningless. The system-UI stack is
  appended behind it — judgment call, noted in the file.
- **`ConfigProvider` wraps the whole page, not just the calendar**, so drawers,
  modals and popovers inherit the theme: AntD threads it through React context,
  not the DOM. Verified live — the day drawer renders at 12px/28px controls in
  compact mode.
- **The switcher panel itself sits outside the themed tree.** It is a demo
  control, not product surface, and at the compact scale it would have shrunk
  along with everything else and become awkward to drive.
- **Scope limit worth knowing before judging the comparison:** this changes AntD
  chrome only — buttons, inputs, selects, checkboxes, drawers, modals, tabs,
  tags, typography. The calendar's own bar colours (Standby blue, AM, PM, On
  Leave amber, the empty-standby red) are separately approved design swatches
  outside this token set and do not move.
- Three exported names (`colorFillAlterSolid`, `fontWeightNormal`,
  `transparent`) have no counterpart in AntD 5's `AliasToken` and are dropped —
  they would not have been read anyway.

### Changed — edit mode replaced by a view-then-edit drawer (MOVE-3967)

The 26 Aug flow change is in Jira: **MOVE-3658 (Edit Roster Mode) is cancelled**
— its summary now reads `[x] Edit Roster Mode (Calendar View)` — and a new
**MOVE-3967 "View Roster - Individual Date (Drawer)"** replaces it. MOVE-3608's
CTA table was rewritten to match.

- **The "Edit Roster" button is gone.** Manage Shift Patterns is the calendar's
  only CTA now.
- **Clicking a day cell opens that day's drawer, read-only** — on any month,
  including past ones. Header reads `View Roster - Thursday, 20 Aug 2026`, with
  the day name spelled out as the ticket asks.
- **The drawer's Edit CTA switches the same drawer into editing** rather than
  opening a second one, which is how MOVE-3967 §3 words it. Header becomes
  `Edit Roster - …` and Cancel/Save replace the Edit button.
- **Edit is disabled on a past month**, with the existing payroll tooltip.
  Viewing stays available there.
- **A bar click and a cell click are separate actions** (MOVE-3608 §3): the bar
  opens the Shift Details Card, the cell opens the day drawer. The bar now stops
  the click propagating, or one press would have done both.

**Consequences of losing the session**

- **A day's Save commits immediately.** There is no calendar-level session left
  to stage into, so the page-level Save/Cancel are gone with it. MOVE-3769 §4
  still describes staging "until user selects 'save all edits' … in edit roster
  mode" — that text predates the flow change and now points at a cancelled
  ticket. Flagged rather than followed.
- **Cancel returns the drawer to viewing** instead of closing it, so you stay on
  the day you were looking at. MOVE-3769 §4.2 says the drawer closes, but that
  line also assumes the cancelled mode.
- **Month navigation is never locked**, and the calendar no longer greys out —
  both existed only to signal edit mode. `EDIT_MODE_GROUP_STYLE` and the
  `greyed` prop were swept.

### Added — suspension is now date-aware (MOVE-3608 + MOVE-3769, both updated 25 Aug)

Xing Yun's report was right and both tickets now say so in writing. MOVE-3769:
*"If employee status = suspended on selected date → display 'suspended' tag
beside employee's name **+ disable all fields in employee's row**"*. MOVE-3608:
*"**Even if assigned, don't include** employee in Standby/AM/PM/N.A. count for
that date if … Employee status = suspended for that date"*.

**The model had to change first.** MOVE-3608's own example runs "suspended from
10–20 Aug … on 21 Aug the count includes them again", so suspension is a period,
not a flag — and `RosterEmployee.status` was a single static label that could not
express it. Applying the rule to the static label would have excluded a
suspended employee from every day of every month.

- **`RosterEmployee.suspensions`** — a list of `{ startDate, endDate? }` periods,
  with `isSuspendedOn(employee, date)` in the shared logic as the single answer
  the drawer, the counts and the details card all consult. `status` stays the
  plain HR label the older matrix variants group by. In production this would
  sync from the HR Employee module (MOVE-1607).
- **Fixtures** carry the ticket's own example: Farhan Hakim suspended 10–20 Aug,
  Gita Permata 24–26 Aug, so the behaviour changes mid-month and can be checked.

**Behaviour**

- **Drawer** — a suspended row keeps its place in the list, gains a `Suspended`
  tag beside the name, and every field is locked: shift buttons, Standby, Extend
  and Absence.
- **Counts** — suspended staff drop out of Standby / AM / PM / Not Assigned,
  exactly as absent staff already did. Verified against the ticket's example:
  20 Aug reads `AM (3)`, 21 Aug reads `AM (4)` — same week, same pattern, the
  only difference being that Farhan's suspension ended.
- **Details card** — they stay listed with the tag, because MOVE-3659 wants the
  list to include everyone assigned *"regardless of suspension, absence, or
  leave"*. Verified: 11 Aug's PM card lists Farhan Hakim tagged `Suspended`
  while the bar count excludes him; on 21 Aug the tag is gone.
- **Highlights** — a suspended employee no longer counts as standby or shift
  cover for the 60-day badges.

### Changed — Edit Roster drawer actions moved to the header

Cancel and Save were in a footer at the bottom of the drawer; they now sit at
the top right of the header, matching the Create Event pattern. This also puts
them beside the close button and keeps them in view while a long employee list
scrolls. The Manage Shift Patterns drawer already carried its action there, so
the two now agree.

Save still stays disabled until something is actually staged.

Scoped to drawers, as asked — the Shift Patterns / Extend / Standby dialogs are
AntD Modals and keep their footers.

### Changed — 22 Aug review

**Pattern editor: names live in the control (item 1)**

The paragraph of names under each cell is gone. Staff now appear as removable
tags inside the dropdown itself, following the Fleet Owner control the review
pointed at:

- **Three tags visible, then `+n`.** One tag fills a cell line, so three is the
  three-line cap the review asked for. A `7 selected` subtext keeps the total
  readable at a glance.
- **The option list is grouped by state** — `Selected (n)`, `Available`,
  `Unavailable (AM)` — so the eye lands on what is already picked before
  scanning what is free. Empty groups are omitted.
- Cells widened 124px → 148px and the modal 1180 → 1320 to fit all seven day
  columns without clipping Sunday.

**Shift pattern card (items 3, 4)**

- Both axes of the headcount table read **bold** — the week/shift row labels as
  well as the day headers. Both are labels; only one was.
- Tab counts became **circular badges** (`Current ●1`) instead of `(1)`,
  matching the badge the routes module already uses.

### Fixed — details card was missing the extension reason (item 5, MOVE-3659)

The card showed an `Extended` tag with nothing to explain it. MOVE-3659 was
rewritten on 21 Aug (and renamed *Shift Details Card*); its table asks for the
tag **plus the reason for extension**, so the hours and reason now read under
the tag: `4h · Covering late run`.

This reverses the 18 Aug reading that confined reasons to the Standby card.
Checking the ticket, as asked, also turned up three other gaps we had not met:

- **Standby always names its reason.** MOVE-3659 wants one beside every standby
  name — *"'Assigned in pattern', or whatever user manually input"*. Standby
  that came from the rule showed nothing; it now reads `Assigned in pattern`.
- **Suspended staff carry a tag.** The ticket says the list includes all
  assigned employees *"regardless of suspension, absence, or leave"*, each
  tagged. Absent and Extended were tagged; Suspended was not.
- **Empty standby copy** matches the ticket's `No employee assigned`.

The ticket also confirms in writing that the bar count and the card list need
not match — which is what the absent-but-listed rule produces.

**Not done, deliberately:** the ticket's `on leave` tag inside shift groups is
bracketed `[Implement after leave module]` and says to assume a zero leave count
for now. Adding it would also contradict MOVE-3608, where On Leave overrides
every other status and is its own exclusive group. Left alone and raised here.

### Changed — public holidays name themselves in the cell (feedback 6)

The flag icon is gone and so is the green cell wash. A holiday now prints its
name on the date row — `17 Independence Day` — in small green text.

- The flag meant nothing until hovered; the name says what the day is on sight.
- Removing the tint also removes a competing signal: with the group colours
  already carrying meaning, a green background made holidays look like a status
  rather than a label. Verified 17 Aug and 18 Aug now share the same white
  background, and no flag icon remains anywhere.
- The name sits on the existing date row rather than a new line, so cell height
  is unchanged in every calendar density; it truncates with an ellipsis and
  keeps the full text in a title tooltip for the compact styles.
- The legend's **Public Holiday chip is dropped**. It keyed the flag and the
  green wash, neither of which is drawn any more, and a holiday is not one of
  the group bars the legend exists to explain.

The green *text* is a judgment call — it keeps the holiday association the wash
used to carry without tinting the day. Say the word if it should be neutral.

### Changed — 19 Aug review: pattern editor and drawer legibility

**Pattern editor**

- **Day headers read Mon–Sun** instead of `M T W T F S S`. The single letters
  were ambiguous (two Ts, two Ss) and the column had room for the full name.
- **Names stack one per line** under each cell. As a comma-separated run they
  wrapped into a four-line block that broke mid-name, so you could not tell
  where one ended and the next began. Cells widened from 112px to 124px and the
  text stepped darker (`#595959`).
- **Effective Date is editable until it has passed.** MOVE-3610 specifies it as
  view-only, derived from the previous rule; the review asks for it to stay
  editable while it is still in the future, and to lock only once the date is
  past — at which point the roster it produced is history. A Current rule stays
  locked wholesale per MOVE-3611. Past dates cannot be picked, and the End Date
  picker re-validates against the new Effective Date.

**Edit Roster drawer**

- **Standby now comes before Extend**, in the header and every layout. Standby
  is the coverage decision; Extend is a detail on top of a shift already
  assigned.
- **The table carries real contrast.** It read as one pale wash: header
  `#fafafa` on light-grey text, `#f5f5f5` row rules, and AntD's default
  `#d9d9d9` control border left unticked checkboxes almost invisible. Header is
  now `#f0f0f0` with `#434343` bold text, borders `#d9d9d9`/`#e8e8e8`, sub-text
  `#595959`, and a scoped `ConfigProvider` darkens the checkbox border to
  `#8c8c8c` for this drawer only. The shift picker's unselected tiles darkened
  to match.

### Fixed — highlight copy was inverted (feedback 5)

The spec table settles the open item raised when this wording first landed:

| Copy | Counts |
|---|---|
| X unassigned **standby** in next 60 days | days where no employee is assigned standby duty |
| X unassigned **shift** in next 60 days | days where no employee is assigned an AM or PM shift |

The two labels had been applied in the order they were written in an earlier
review, which put "unassigned shift" on the standby count and "unassigned
roster" on the AM/PM count — backwards for both, and flagged as an open item at
the time rather than silently swapped. They now read `0 unassigned standby` and
`10 unassigned shift`, and "roster" is gone from the copy entirely.

### Changed — the day being edited keeps its colour (Xing Yun)

Edit mode greys every group bar, which made the mode obvious but also flattened
the day you are actually working on. The day open in the drawer now keeps the
full palette while the rest of the month stays grey, so the selection reads at a
glance. Verified on 6 Aug: before selecting, all four bars are `#f0f0f0`; once
selected they return to Standby blue, AM purple, PM periwinkle and On Leave
amber, while 5 Aug stays grey.

### Changed — status tag holds one position (feedback 3)

The On Leave / Absence tag sat inline after the name, so a long name pushed it
onto a second line and made that row taller than its neighbours. The tag is now
pinned to the right of the Employee cell and never shrinks; the name takes the
remaining width and truncates with an ellipsis, keeping the full text in a title
tooltip. The Employee column also took back the width the checkbox labels gave
up when those were removed.

Measured with a 57-character name injected into a tagged row: the tag's right
edge stays at the same x for every row, before and after, and the set of row
heights is unchanged.

### Changed — AM and PM are mutually exclusive per day again (feedback 4)

Picking someone for AM used to silently pull them out of that day's PM list.
The old per-pattern editor disabled an employee already assigned elsewhere, and
that is the behaviour the review asks for: somebody on AM is now **disabled** in
the same day's PM dropdown, labelled `— on AM` so the reason is visible, and
vice versa. The silent-release code is gone; nothing moves without being asked.

The clash test skips anyone already in the cell being edited, so a person who
somehow ended up in both lists can still be taken out of either.

Standby is unrestricted — it is independent of the shift (MOVE-3608), so an
employee can hold Shift + Standby on the same day.

### Fixed — raw employee ids in the pattern editor

Cells listed `emp-10, emp-12, emp-7…` instead of names. MOVE-3610 limits the
dropdown to Active employees, but a stored pattern can still name someone since
suspended or whose contract ended, and those ids had no entry to resolve
against. Names now come from the full roster, and already-assigned inactive
staff appear in the list tagged `— inactive`: they can be removed, but not
added anywhere new. Surfaced while verifying feedback 4, not reported.

### Changed — edit mode strips every group colour

Entering Edit Roster now turns all calendar bars a single neutral grey, so the
calendar itself says which mode you are in rather than leaving it to the
Save/Cancel buttons. This is also MOVE-3658 §2, "All group color to be remove",
which had not been picked up yet.

**One consequence worth watching:** the red `Standby (0)` gap indicator greys out
with everything else, so while editing you cannot see which days lack standby
cover — arguably the moment you would most want to. The instruction is explicit
in both the review and the ticket, so it ships as asked; say the word if that
one should stay red.

### Removed — repeated checkbox labels in the drawer's table layouts

Each row spelled out "Extend", "Standby" and "Absence" under column headers that
already said EXTEND / STANDBY / ABSENCE. The rows now carry bare checkboxes.
The stacked layout keeps its labels — it has no column headers to lean on.

### Changed — mock roster data made realistic (Daniel, 18 Aug)

The fixtures left several Operations staff unrostered on weekdays, which does
not happen in real operations. Rewritten so each day type carries only the
groups it should:

| Day | Groups |
|---|---|
| Mon–Fri | Standby, AM, PM |
| Sat | Standby, AM, Not Assigned |
| Sun | Standby, Not Assigned |

- All 13 Operations employees now sit in AM or PM every weekday, split into two
  teams that swap between week 1 and week 2 of the cycle. Saturday runs a
  three-person AM crew; Sunday nobody works.
- Standby rotates through the week per person instead of resting on one name.
- Leave is spread across 18 days of August rather than clustering. `lv-4` lands
  deliberately on a standby day (Eka is the week-1 Mon–Wed standby), so the red
  `Standby (0)` state still arises the way it does in real life — somebody was
  rostered to cover and then went on leave. That surfaces on 10–11 Aug.

Verified across all 31 days of August 2026: no day carries a group outside its
allowed set. The one apparent exception is **17 Aug**, a public holiday, where
MOVE-3608 requires every roster to become NA — a rule, not a data problem.

**Worth raising:** with Sunday now a proper rest day, the "unassigned roster"
highlight counts 9 days in the next 60 — 8 Sundays plus Malaysia Day. The badge
is behaving as MOVE-3607 defines it, but flagging intentional non-working days
as a coverage gap may not be what the badge is for.

### Added — Variant 7: shift pattern card style

The rule card's weekly headcounts can now be drawn two ways, on request:

- **Plain** (default, unchanged) — an open grid with no rules or fills.
- **Table** — bordered cells with a shaded header row, and the standby lines
  boxed to match, which is how the design sketch draws it.

Both render from the same `rule.weeks` data; only the chrome differs. The older
matrix variants share the drawer but have no switcher, so the prop defaults to
Plain there.

### Removed — Off Day (18 Aug review §5)

Off Day is gone as a concept. "Rostered but not working today" and "not in any
rule" were always the same thing to an ops user, and the review collapsed them
into a single **Not Assigned** (NA). This confirms the direction MOVE-3608 and
MOVE-3769 took on 18 Aug, which had been held pending the contradiction with
MOVE-3610.

- `ShiftCode` is now `'AM' | 'PM'`; `DailyStatus` loses `'OFF'`; the `OFF` and
  `NO_ROSTER` calendar groups merge into `NOT_ASSIGNED`.
- **Public holidays resolve to NA**, not Off Day. The edit drawer's picker shows
  NA alone that day, and the banner was reworded.
- **Weekends offer AM or NA**; a PM assignment on a weekend resolves to NA
  rather than being rewritten to Off Day.
- `ruleAssignmentFor` no longer needs rule membership: with both states collapsed
  the only question is whether the employee is in a shift list for that day.
- `DailyCoverage.off` dropped; public holidays now count under `na`.
- The two older matrix variants lost their Off Day cell colour, legend entry and
  bulk action, so their weekend bulk bar now offers AM only.

### Changed — fixed group order and the 18 Aug colours (§5, §6)

Order is now **Standby, AM, PM, Not Assigned, On Leave**, and the palette moved
to the review's swatches:

| Group | Fill | Text |
|---|---|---|
| Standby | `#2563eb` | white |
| Standby, count 0 | `#ef4444` | white |
| AM | `#a5a0f5` | black |
| PM | `#aec2fa` | black |
| Not Assigned | `#d4d4d4` | black |
| On Leave | `#fbdc8a` | black |

- **A group with a count of zero is dropped from the calendar — except Standby**,
  which stays and turns red. Zero is the thing worth seeing there: a day with no
  standby cover is a gap, and hiding the bar would hide the gap. In August 2026
  that surfaces four such days (9, 12, 14, 23 Aug).
- Standby regains a solid dark fill, so it no longer depends on being first in
  the order to stand out — the concern noted when the 14 Aug pastel palette
  landed.

### Changed — details card contents (18 Aug review §4)

`DayGroup` now carries `count` separately from `members`, because the two
deliberately disagree.

- **Absent staff are listed but not counted.** They used to be dropped from the
  group entirely, which meant the card could not show who was meant to be
  covering. They now appear with an **Absent** tag while the bar's headcount
  excludes them — verified on 20 Aug: marking one AM employee absent moved the
  bar from `AM (5)` to `AM (4)` with the name still in the card.
- **Extended staff are counted and tagged** `Extended`.
- **Reasons are confined to the Standby card.** The extension reason used to
  ride along in the shift group's card; the review keeps reasons to standby
  only, so a shift card now lists names and tags alone.

### Changed — shift patterns reshaped to the ADR-style grid (18 Aug review)

The three items in the review land together, because the first two change the
same data model.

**1. Button copy.** "Manage Roster" → **Manage Shift Patterns** (the button on
the calendar and the drawer's own title), and the drawer's "+ Add Rule" →
**Add Shift Patterns**. The modal, toasts, delete confirmation and empty states
follow the same vocabulary, so "rule" no longer appears in user-facing copy.
The two older matrix variants share the drawer and were updated with it.

**2. How patterns are added.** The editor is now grouped by week, split by
shift, with each day assigning employees from a dropdown — replacing the
per-employee pattern cards. The old editor asked "which days does this group
work?"; this one asks "who works this shift on this day?".

This required reshaping the stored model. `RosterRulePattern`/`PatternWeek` are
gone; a rule now holds `RuleWeek[]`, where each week carries `am`, `pm` and
`standby` as seven per-day arrays of employee ids. Consequences:

- **Standby moved from per-week to per-day.** It was one checkbox covering the
  whole week; it is now assigned day by day, which is what the sketch's separate
  "Standby week 1" row and the view's "Hity (Mon–Wed, Sat)" summary both need.
- **PM is disabled on Sat/Sun** in the grid rather than accepted and silently
  corrected later, matching MOVE-3608's weekend rule.
- **One shift per employee per day** is enforced as you type: putting someone in
  AM removes them from PM on that day.
- **Not being in a shift list is the whole answer.** An employee not named in
  the AM or PM list for a day is Not Assigned, resolved by `ruleAssignmentFor`
  in the shared logic so all three page variants move together. (This landed
  first as an Off Day / No Roster distinction based on rule membership; §5 of
  the same review then removed Off Day, so the distinction went with it.)
- Day cells are too narrow for name tags, so each control shows a headcount with
  the names listed underneath, as the sketch draws them.

**3. How patterns are viewed.** The rule card now shows a headcount per shift
per day (`Week 1 - AM  3 3 3 3 3 3 3`) with standby summarised per person below
(`Week 1 Standby: Bella Santoso (Mon–Wed, Sat) | Eka Wijaya (Thu–Fri, Sun)`),
consecutive days collapsed into ranges. Edit and Delete keep exactly the
behaviour MOVE-3609/3705 specify — Edit on every card, Delete on Upcoming only,
and a Current rule still locks everything but its End Date.

Mock data was rewritten into the new shape. Calendar output is unchanged except
for standby counts, which now vary by day instead of applying to a whole week.

### Changed — page header reworked to the target design (17 Aug)

- **Breadcrumb is rooted in a home icon** and the Roster 4.0 route now reads
  `/ Roster`. The icon is added in `AppLayout`, so every page in the prototype
  picks it up, not just this one.
- **Page title is plainly "Roster"** (`Roster Calendar 4.0` before), larger and
  bolder. The 4.0 is a prototype variant number and does not belong in product
  copy; the sidebar still names the variant so the three can be told apart.
- **Highlights became stat cards** on their own row between the title and the
  calendar, rather than inline pills floated right of the title. The count reads
  large with what it counts underneath. They remain clickable filters: the
  active card carries a blue border, replacing the old tinted-pill treatment
  that leaned on a per-highlight tone colour.

  The design mock showed a large number *and* a second number inside the label
  (`14` above `12 unassigned shift`). The count is rendered once, as the number —
  showing two different figures on one card would only raise the question of
  which one is real.

### Changed — On Leave rows in the Edit Roster drawer (feedback 2)

- **The On Leave tag now carries the calendar's On Leave swatch** (`#ffa6c9` on
  black) instead of AntD's gold, so the same status reads the same colour in the
  grid and in the drawer.
- **The row highlight is gone.** An On Leave row had a yellow background on top
  of its tag and disabled controls, which made the one row nobody can edit the
  loudest thing in the drawer. It now looks like every other row and says
  view-only the way an Absence row does — through its own disabled fields.
- **On Leave rows keep their Extend / Standby / Absence checkboxes, disabled**,
  rather than leaving three empty cells in the table. Their sub-text is
  suppressed though: leave clears standby (MOVE-3608), so "Standby from Rule"
  under an unticked, disabled box would claim an assignment that does not exist
  that day.

### Fixed

- **"Off Day" wrapped to two lines in the shift picker**, so weekend and holiday
  rows in the Edit Roster drawer stood ~25px taller than weekday rows. The
  buttons no longer wrap and the table's Shift column widened from 148px to
  180px to fit the longest option set. Measured on 15 Aug (weekend) and 20 Aug
  (weekday): row heights and total content height are now identical at 513px.
- **Public holidays overflowed the Shift column.** The picker was built by
  appending Off Day to the day's normal options, which on a weekday holiday gave
  a four-option row (AM/PM/NA/Off Day) too wide for the column — the label was
  clipped into the Extend column. Since the shift is fixed and read-only that
  day, the picker now shows Off Day alone; the banner above already explains
  why. Found while verifying the wrapping fix, not reported.

### Changed — group colours set to the design's "Final Selected" swatches

| Group | Fill | Hover | Text |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standby | `#ffd59e` | `#ffc069` | `#1a1a1a` |
| Off Day | `#d9d9d9` | `#bfbfbf` | `#1a1a1a` |
| AM | `#7fe7d5` | `#4fd8c0` | `#1a1a1a` |
| PM | `#aec2fa` | `#87a5f7` | `#1a1a1a` |
| No Roster | `#fce588` | `#f7d94c` | `#1a1a1a` |
| On Leave | `#ffa6c9` | `#ff7fb2` | `#1a1a1a` |

Set once in `DAY_GROUP_STYLE`, so the calendar bars, the legend chips and the
details card all move together. Two behavioural consequences, both intended by
the swatches but worth recording:

- **Fill no longer encodes severity.** Every group is a light pastel with black
  text, so Standby lost the solid dark blue that made it the loudest bar. Being
  first in `DAY_GROUP_ORDER` is now the only thing that makes it findable.
- **No Roster is a real fill.** It was a transparent, dashed outline that read
  as "nothing here"; it is now solid yellow and drops its border, so a day with
  unrostered staff carries as much visual weight as one without.

The On Leave chip in the drawer's "Separate section" variant now reads from the
On Leave swatch instead of carrying its own red. The two older matrix variants
(`RosterPage`, `Roster3Page`) keep their existing `STATUS_COLORS` palette — the
swatches name the Roster 4.0 groups, and those pages are already flagged for
retirement in Open items.

### Added — fourth review round: Edit Roster drawer layouts (feedback 1)

The stacked list ran too long to scan — at 480px wide, nine staff overflowed the
drawer. Two table layouts were added and put on the switcher as **Variant 6**,
with the stacked list kept as the third option. Measured on 20 Aug 2026 (nine
staff): stacked 929px of content, table 513px, grouped table 621px. Table is now
the default; only the stacked list still scrolls.

- **Table** — one row per employee across fixed columns (Employee / Shift /
  Extend / Standby / Absence), with a sticky header. Drawer widens to 760px for
  the table layouts and stays at 480px for the stacked list.
- **Grouped table** — the same rows split into sections by the shift each
  employee is currently on, each with a count (`AM (5)`, `No Roster (3)`,
  `On Leave (1)`), for reading coverage rather than individuals.

All three layouts share one set of cell renderers, so a behaviour fix lands in
every layout at once — the same reasoning that keeps the status rules in
`rosterStatusLogic.tsx`.

### Changed — fourth review round

- **Calendar bar order is now Standby, AM, PM, Off Day, No Roster, On Leave**,
  set in `DAY_GROUP_ORDER` so every variant follows. Previously On Leave sat
  second, directly under Standby. The 14 Aug review first placed Off Day ahead
  of AM; the 17 Aug review corrected it to sit after PM, because putting Off Day
  second made weekend cells — where most staff are off — read in a different
  sequence from weekday cells. Verified across all 31 populated day cells of
  August 2026, weekends and the 17 Aug public holiday included.
- **Highlight pills reworded** (feedback 3) to `12 unassigned shift in next 60
  days` and `13 unassigned roster in next 60 days`. **Flagged:** applied in the
  order the two labels were written, which puts "unassigned shift" on the
  standby-coverage count and "unassigned roster" on the AM/PM count — the
  reverse of what each one measures. Left as written rather than silently
  swapped; see Open items.

### Removed

- **The page subtitle** "Operations department — month grid with daily coverage"
  and **the legend row** above the calendar (feedback 2). The legend's two
  earlier behaviours stay reachable through **Variant 3**, which became a
  three-way choice — Hidden (the new default), Filters, Plain — rather than the
  on/off switch it was, so the removal ships without losing the filtering
  behaviour built last round.

### Changed — third review round (Edit Roster drawer)

All four items land in the drawer's employee rows.

- **Each modifier's state now sits under its own checkbox** (feedback 2). The
  row's checkboxes became a three-column grid — Extend / Standby / Absence — and
  the detail belonging to each one is rendered directly beneath it: the
  extension reads `4h · <reason>` under Extend, and "Standby from Rule" plus the
  standby reason sit under Standby. Previously both were pooled into a shared
  `Extension: … Standby: …` line at the end of the row, which meant reading the
  label to work out which checkbox a value belonged to.
- **The extension detail is grouped with the Extend checkbox** (feedback 6),
  which is the same move as above seen from the other side: the `Extend 4h` tag
  that used to trail the shift picker is gone, so the hours and the reason are
  in one place rather than split across the row.
- **The Absence tag moved next to the employee name** (feedback 5). It used to
  sit beside the shift selector, where it read as a property of the shift.
  Absence is a property of the person for that day, so it now reads with the
  name. Marking someone absent also disables their Extend and Standby
  checkboxes — an absent employee is not covering a shift, so they cannot be
  extended or held on standby either.
- **Re-ticking rule-assigned standby no longer asks for a reason** (feedback 5).
  Unticking Standby for an employee the roster rule puts on standby and then
  ticking it again used to open the reason modal, as if it were a manual
  assignment. It now restores the rule's standby directly; only standby the user
  is genuinely adding by hand goes through the modal.

### Removed

- **Placeholder text in the Extend and Standby modals** (feedback 3). Both
  fields already carry a label and a required marker, and the placeholders
  ("Why is this employee on standby?", "Why is this shift being extended?",
  "e.g. 2") only restated them. The screenshot marked the standby one; the
  Extend modal's two were removed with it so the pair stays consistent.

### Changed — second review round

- **Public holidays now override No Roster too** (feedback 5). Employees with no
  roster rule used to keep a No Roster bar on a holiday; they now read Off Day
  like everyone else, so 17 Aug went from `Standby (2) · Off Day (6) ·
  No Roster (2)` to `Standby (2) · Off Day (8)`. This puts the holiday check
  ahead of the No Roster check, the reverse of MOVE-3608's priority table —
  nobody is working on a public holiday, rostered or not.
- **The shift picker carries real contrast** (feedback 7). AntD's Segmented
  rendered the selected option as a barely-distinguishable white tile, which lost
  next to the bright blue Standby checkbox. Replaced with a small custom control
  whose selected option is a solid blue fill. Available as **Variant 4** in the
  switcher, with the original look kept as "Subtle".
- **On Leave staff can sit in the main list** (feedback 1) with their shift shown
  but disabled and an On Leave tag, so ops can see which shift the person was
  meant to cover. Available as **Variant 5**, with the original separate
  view-only section kept as "Separate section". `resolveShiftIgnoringLeave`
  derives the underlying shift by re-running the normal rules with that
  employee's leave removed, rather than duplicating the priority chain.

### Removed

- The edit-mode helper line above the calendar.

### Added — MOVE-3769 Edit Roster Calendar Drawer

The drawer spec was split out of MOVE-3658 into its own ticket on 12 Aug and
grew considerably.

- **NA is now a shift option.** Weekdays offer AM/PM/NA, weekends AM/Off Day/NA.
  NA is an explicit "no roster rule applies" pick, distinct from an employee
  simply having no pattern, so `RosterOverride.shift` widened to a new
  `ShiftSelection` type.
- **Extend checkbox.** Ticking it opens a modal asking for the number of hours
  and a reason, both required; the box only turns on once they are saved, so
  cancelling leaves it untouched. Extend is independent of the shift — an
  employee can hold Shift + Extend + Standby.
- **Standby now captures a reason.** Ticking Standby by hand opens a modal
  requiring a reason, shown next to the checkbox afterwards and cleared when
  unticked. Standby that comes from the roster rule does not go through the
  modal.
- **"Standby from Rule" indicator**, shown for employees the rule puts on
  standby and deliberately kept visible even after the user unticks the box.
- **Absence checkbox.** The employee keeps their shift, but the shift control
  locks and an Absence tag appears beside it; unticking restores editing.

### Changed

- Group counts exclude employees marked Absent (MOVE-3608 §2.2). They keep a
  shift in the drawer but are not covering it, so counting them overstated the
  day's coverage. Roster 3.0's coverage strip follows the same rule.
- The details card shows the reason where one was captured — extension reason in
  shift groups, standby reason in the Standby group (MOVE-3659 §1). `DayGroup`
  now carries `members` (employee + reason) rather than a bare employee list.

### Changed — Roster 4.0 aligned with the 11 Aug ticket rewrite

MOVE-3608, MOVE-3658, MOVE-3659 and MOVE-3610 were all rewritten on 11 Aug. Two
of the revisions contradicted what was already built.

- **Standby is now an independent assignment** (MOVE-3608). It previously pulled
  an employee out of their shift group onto the Standby bar. The ticket now
  states that adding or removing standby must not change the AM/PM/Off Day
  assignment and that an employee can hold both, so grouping is additive: an
  employee rostered AM and put on standby appears in `AM (n)` *and*
  `Standby (n)`. On Leave stays exclusive. Because the ticket also says
  employees on leave cannot be assigned standby, `resolveDailyStatus` now clears
  the flag on leave rather than leaving it to each caller.
- **Off Day is no longer assignable on a weekday** (MOVE-3658 §3). The edit
  drawer offers AM/PM on weekdays and AM/Off Day on weekends via a shared
  `shiftOptionsForDay` helper. The Create/Edit Roster Rule week grid follows:
  weekdays cycle `AM → PM → AM` (MOVE-3610), with an existing weekday Off Day
  resolving back to AM so older data is never stuck outside the cycle.
- **The edit drawer has its own Save/Cancel** (MOVE-3658 §3). Changes are staged
  in the drawer and only reach the session draft on drawer Save; Cancel or
  closing discards that day. The page-level Save/Cancel still commits or
  discards the whole session across every edited day.
- **Public holidays lock shift editing** (MOVE-3658, revised 15:02). On a public
  holiday the shift control is disabled with Off Day selected, while the standby
  checkbox stays live and does not affect the Off Day assignment. A banner
  explains the state so the disabled control does not read as a bug.
- **Employees are listed A–Z by name** in the details card (MOVE-3659 §2) and the
  edit drawer (MOVE-3658 §3), replacing the status-then-name ordering the
  rewritten tickets no longer ask for.

### Added

- Hover feedback on the roster bars in each Roster 4.0 day cell, on request.
  Each group darkens one step on the same AntD colour ramp, so a hovered bar
  reads as the same status rather than a different one. "No Roster" is
  transparent and has nothing to darken, so it fills in with a light grey and
  its dashed border deepens instead. The bar whose details card is open stays
  darkened, which doubles as a pointer back to the anchor. Bars do not react in
  edit mode, where the day cell — not the bar — is the click target.

### Changed

- The Off Day group reads **"Off Day"** rather than "Off", in the calendar bars,
  the legend, the Manage Roster rule cards and the Create/Edit Roster Rule week
  grid. The rule card's day cell widened from 44px to 52px so the longer label
  still fits on one line.

### Removed

- The "Click a bar to see which staff are in it…" helper line above the Roster
  4.0 calendar, on request. The edit-mode helper line stays, since that mode's
  interaction is not self-evident.
- The `"No Roster" = joined, no roster set` subtext from the Roster 4.0 legend.
- The leave type/timing tooltip on the On Leave chips in the Edit Roster drawer.
  Operations hours differ from the rest of the company, so someone on leave is
  effectively unavailable regardless of a half-day marker, and surfacing the
  timing invited the wrong inference.
- The "… — click to cycle" tooltip on the Create/Edit Roster Rule week grid.
- The "Hide/Show … from the calendar" tooltip on the legend chips. The chips
  still filter; the greyed-out, struck-through state already says which groups
  are hidden.

### Fixed

- The floating variant switcher covered the edit drawer's Save button. It now
  sits below AntD's drawer/modal layer (z-index 900 vs 1000).

### Added — floating calendar variant switcher (Roster 4.0)

A draggable, hideable demo panel, following the same pattern as
`notification/StatusSwitcher.tsx`. Not a PRD feature.

- **Variant 1 — calendar style**, four densities. Measured at a 1000px viewport:
  Comfortable renders a 1118px page (scrolls), Compact (84px cells) and Chips
  (62px cells) both land at 1000px and fit without scrolling, Detailed (180px)
  trades height for showing staff names inline.
- **Variant 2 — freeze the Mon–Sun header row**, or let it scroll with the grid.
- **Variant 3 — legend chips as filters**: clicking one hides that group from
  every day cell. The toggle turns the behaviour off so the chips read as a
  plain legend.

In Chips style the bar labels shorten to initial + count (`S2`, `A3`, `NR3`);
the full label would not fit on one line and would force the cell wider,
defeating the density the style exists for. Full names remain on hover.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-07

Roster module release. Adds an Operations section to the sidebar implementing
epic **MOVE-3429 (WLA: HR - Roster)**.

### Added

- **Roster Calendar 4.0** (`Roster4Page.tsx`) — conventional month grid,
  Monday–Sunday, greyed adjacent-month days, today highlighted, roster
  information as grouped bars `Group (n)` for On Leave / AM / PM / Off Day /
  No Roster / Standby, public holiday indicator, 12-month forward navigation,
  legend. As of the 11 Aug rewrite this is the variant that matches the PRD.
- **Roster Highlights** (MOVE-3607) — two badges over a rolling 60-day window
  from today: days with no standby coverage, and days with no AM/PM shift
  assigned. Rendered as compact pills on the title row that also filter the
  calendar to their affected days.
- **Manage Roster drawer** (MOVE-3609) — Current/Upcoming tabs, rule cards with
  effective range, patterns, weekly grids, standby and assignees. Ended rules
  hidden. Per-tab empty states.
- **Create / Edit Roster Rule** (MOVE-3610 / MOVE-3611) — one modal for both.
  Effective Date defaults to the day after the latest rule's end and pre-fills
  the previous rule's patterns; one employee per pattern per rule; a Current
  rule exposes only its End Date and hides Add/Remove Pattern. Overlapping
  periods rejected.
- **Delete Roster Rule** (MOVE-3705) — Upcoming rules only, behind a
  confirmation.
- **Edit Roster mode** (MOVE-3658) — current and future months only, past months
  disabled with a payroll tooltip, month navigation locked while editing, pick a
  day to edit it in a drawer, session-level Save/Cancel.
- **View Details Card** (MOVE-3659) — clicking a roster bar opens a view-only
  popover anchored to it, listing the staff in that group.
- **Roster Calendar** (`RosterPage.tsx`) and **Roster 3.0** (`Roster3Page.tsx`)
  — earlier matrix-layout explorations (employees as rows, dates as columns),
  kept side by side per the repo's original/2.0 convention. Roster 3.0 adds a
  per-day AM/PM headcount strip, status-grouped rows and filters.

### Changed — 7 Aug review feedback (Xing Yun Lee / Daniel Roy)

- Legend moved above the calendar, restyled after the Operations Calendar chip
  row.
- Day cells switched from small count chips to stacked bars `Group (n)`.
- **Coverage Gap removed entirely** — no longer a product concept, so it was
  dropped from the shared logic and all three variants, not just the calendar.
  Roster 3.0 lost its coverage-gaps filter toggle as a consequence.
- Public holidays read light green instead of red; a holiday is not an error
  state.
- Highlights realigned to the title row and made clickable filters.
- Clicking a bar opens a details card anchored to it rather than a drawer; the
  drawer became the edit-mode surface.

### Notes on the domain model

Follows the PRD's vocabulary: a **Roster Rule** owns an effective period and
repeat cycle and contains **Patterns**, each with its own weekly grids, per-week
standby flag and assigned employees. Rules may not overlap. There is no backend,
so mutations edit the shared mock arrays in place, consistent with the rest of
this repo.

## Open items

Tracked here so they do not get lost between sessions.

| Item | Status |
|---|---|
| **Public Holiday vs On Leave precedence** — MOVE-3608 carries an unresolved PM note: *"Should be PH over on leave cause it was their rest day hmm"*. Current behaviour keeps **On Leave winning**, per priority 1 as still written. | Awaiting PM decision |
| **Roster Calendar and Roster 3.0 are off-spec** — MOVE-3608 no longer describes a matrix layout at all, and both still use the bulk-select edit model MOVE-3658 replaced. | Awaiting a call on whether to retire them |
| **MOVE-3660 [Payroll] Standby Calculation** — ticket has no description. | Not implemented |
| **MOVE-3759 Design - Roster** — placeholder with no description, attachments, links or comments. | Nothing to build from |
| **"No Roster" vs "Not Assigned"** — resolved by the 18 Aug review: Off Day is removed and both states collapse into Not Assigned. | Resolved |
| **Highlight pill wording is inverted** | Resolved 19 Aug — the spec table confirmed the swap; now "unassigned standby" and "unassigned shift". |
| **MOVE-3608 internal inconsistency** — the AC still says "3 leading and trailing read-only dates", "scrolled into view" and "employee ordering follows the defined employee status sequence", all leftovers from the matrix version the body no longer describes. Implementation follows the body. | Worth raising with the PM |

## Earlier history

Changes before the Roster module (Customer Contracts, Invoice, Customer
Notification, Live Tracking) predate this changelog. See `git log` and
`DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for the structural picture, and `CLAUDE_SESSION_CONTEXT.md`
for the PRD-derived business rules of those modules.
